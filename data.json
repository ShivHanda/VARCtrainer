The emphasis here is on mixing traditional and solarpunk styles to create a unique rendering of urban Japan.

Hendlin is the editor-in-chief of the journalBiosemiotics, and the co-editor of books includingFood and Medicine: A Biosemiotic Perspective(2021) andBeing Algae: Transformations in Water, Plants(2024).\n\nIn Indra\u2019s Net of pearls and jewels, every gem reflects every other, a shimmering image of interdependence. This ancient Vedic metaphor for connection across the cosmos also illuminates what the environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht first proposed in 2014as \u2018theSymbiocene\u2019: the era after the Anthropocene, in which human technologies take their cues from living systems and work in partnership rather than through dominance. The term ties technological curiosity to biophilia \u2013 our love of life \u2013 so that what we make is shaped by the living world we belong to, until the boundary between the built world and nature begins to soften. If the Anthropocene began when the Industrial Revolution set industry against the living world, the Symbiocene imagines what should follow: interspecies democracy, life within Earth\u2019s limits, and ecological reciprocity. This is not a future where we engineer nature to fit human comfort and convenience. Instead, creation becomes a conversation: a turning away from our long habit of using technology against nature, toward listening, humility and the flourishing of life.\n\nBut how do we loosen modernity\u2019s grip when we\u2019re still dependent on its tools? The answer is solarpunk, the edgy but sincere cultural movement joining technology with nature \u2013 reimagining technologies based on conceptions of science that coax rather than torture. The \u2018punk\u2019 in solarpunk comes from its blended roots: not rejecting technology like a luddite, nor blindly embracing it like an ecomodernist, but instead yoking technological development to ecological and biological principles to serve the good of the whole. The \u2018solar\u2019 element connects the photosynthetic wonder of plants as light-eaters, with the free energy of the Sun harnessed by solar panels and other forces of nature in wind, water and geothermal energy.\n\nSolarpunk\u2019s point isn\u2019t that a \u2018solar future\u2019 begins and ends with the devices we already know. It widens the meaning of technology to include Indigenous and place-based practices such as chinampas \u2013 raised garden beds woven from reeds, anchored in shallow lakes, and refreshed with nutrient-rich silt from canals. They don\u2019t produce electricity, but they do produce abundance: food, soil and a stable local ecology. Solarpunk puts that kind of low-energy, high-yield ingenuity beside high ecotech like atmospheric water harvesters to pull drinking water out of the air, and regenerative microgrids to store power. In other words, it treats science and technology as plural: shaped by culture, landscape and values, not dictated by a single industrial blueprint. That\u2019s why solarpunk often turns to biomimicry \u2013 learning from nature\u2019s designs \u2013 to aim human ingenuity at repair: restoring ecosystems while also restoring the ways we live with one another.\n\nThink: dirigibles drifting above rooftops, solar panels that repair themselves, permaculture and agroecology \u2013 growing food by designing farms and gardens to work like ecosystems, where soil is rebuilt, water is conserved, and \u2018waste\u2019 becomes nutrient \u2013 meals from what you and your friends helped grow, holograms that ease the glare of screens, and a life measured less by shiny throwaway objects than by shared experiences. The point is not ecologyortechnology, but the refusal of that split. In its queer and eco-anarchic streak, boundaries stay permeable, hierarchies stay suspect, and the world is understood as a set of overlapping relationships rather than sealed categories. From there come its cultural commitments: inclusivity; post-scarcity (the idea that society can meet everyone\u2019s needs); and post-whiteness, meaning no single culture gets to define the default future. Against capitalism\u2019s manufactured inequality, it sketches a more porous way of living, modelled on nature\u2019s interdependence. In that wider frame, truth-telling becomes possible again, long-held wounds can start to heal, and humour returns \u2013 not as denial, but as the relief of not taking ourselves, or our tools, quite so seriously.",

            "text": "If oneness with nature is our evolutionary inheritance, and rising above nature our post-Enlightenment present, then solarpunk imagines a future back in balance. It keeps what technology makes possible, but redirects it toward meeting real needs while cooperating with the living world. The \u2018solar\u2019 in the name matters here. It suggests power that is abundant, gentle and shareable, and it carries a simple claim: the good life does not have to be complicated, wasteful or built on someone else\u2019s loss.\n\nTo get an aesthetic sense of the technologies, watch this solarpunk-inspired commercial, retouched \u2013 in classic solarpunk fashion \u2013 to cut the dialogue and remove all branding\n\nOne way to see this more sharply is to set it beside steampunk, the retro-futurist movement that romanticises an age of steam, adventure and machines still simple enough to mend by hand. For solarpunk, that affection for repairable tools carries over, but the values shift. Here, landscape planning, architecture and infrastructure are treated as ecological questions, not just engineering ones. Progress is measured by peace and sufficiency, and by technologies that strengthen communities, protect the commons, and make everyday life more durable.\n\nThe solarpunk flag, with the half-gear representing technology compatible with nature and the sun representing the infinite potential of the open imagination \u2013 futurism guided by deep sustainability. Courtesy Wikipedia\n\nSelf-sufficient cities, fostering health through clean air, water and lush botanical features, have appeared infuturistic visionsfor decades. Visual representations harken back at least a century to futurists sick of black soot, utilitarian architecture and industrialisation\u2019s pollution sapping the beauty from buildings and the people who lived in them. As housing and architecture itself became industrialised and mass-produced, local flavour evaporated, and the patience to evoke beauty was lost. In the postwar period, it wasn\u2019t only the Soviet Union where ugly block buildings took over. As cement and pre-fab became the tools of the global trade, cities becamedesigned for cars, not humans, and buildings reflected this loss of connection to beauty and nature. Urbanisation at the expense of liveability not only harms our health and dampens the idyllicrus in urbe(bringing the charms of the countryside to the city), it also kills the spirit.\n\nSolarpunk shifts the aesthetic, challenging the austere utilitarianism of the factory and the modern built world. In their place, it ushers in a thriving but not grasping economy; decentralised direct democracies; and nested, loving communities. Nature is treated as a commons. Work is shared and playful, and play productive. Significant leisure time follows the rhythms of pleasure and rest, and doting on nature stewards our nervous system and habitat. The result: a-leave-no-trace ethic, where beauty, health and ecology form a golden braid, civic peace ignites merry prankster creativity, and the priority is a meaningful life.\n\nSolarpunk is just one way of picturing the Symbiocene, where human invention takes its cues from living systems rather than working against them. But the solarpunk movement predated the idea of the Symbiocene itself. Long before Albrecht proposed his replacement for the Anthropocene, before \u2018solarpunk\u2019 was even a label, designers and writers were sketching ecologically grounded cities and asking what it would mean to make the built world hospitable again.\n\nOne early and unusually concrete voice was the urban designer Richard Register, who laid out, in words and drawings, what a solarpunk-like future could look like in his bookEcocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future(1987). His basic claim was that car-centred cities could be redesigned as ecocities. He challenged the defaults of modern planning while treating the city as an ecosystem of bodies and behaviours, not just roads and buildings. In that spirit, ecologically minded architects (sometimes calling themselves \u2018ecotects\u2019) and futurists rallied around the concept. Ernest Callenbach\u2019sEcotopia(1975), Christopher Alexander and colleagues\u2019A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction(1977), and Starhawk\u2019s novelsThe Fifth Sacred Thing(1993) andCity of Refuge(2015) are among forerunner works by Global North visionaries. Many of their ideas ran into real-world gridlock in planning meetings and zoning hearings, and the energy increasingly shifted toward art and story: imagining the worlds that institutions would not yet permit, as in Ursula KLe Guin\u2019snovelThe Dispossessed(1974).",

            "text": "Then there is the Italian American architect Paolo Soleri, who proposed \u2018arcologies\u2019, a blend ofarchitectureandecology.He pictured towering, self-contained cities meant to behave like ecosystems rather than factories. The aim was not power concentrated in glass-and-steel monuments, but land conserved through density so that large areas could be rewilded. When the video gameSimCity 2000in the mid-1990s introduced a secret level based on arcologies, the concept briefly stepped out of architectural theory and into popular imagination.\n\nBy the 2010s, solarpunk had emerged as a green reimagining of steampunk. It also arrived in dialogue with cyberpunk, the high-tech/low-life genre of neon dystopias where corporate power, surveillance and alienation dominate.Solarpunk retains the freedom-loving DIY elegance of both genres but, rather than capitulating, it synthesises them with a green brand of anarchism. Movies likeBlack Panther(2018) and its solarpunk city Wakanda have since brought this futuristic eco-integrated technological vision to the masses. Japan\u2019s Future Design movement, depicted in Roman Krznaric\u2019s bookThe Good Ancestor: How to Think Long Term in a Short-Term World(2020), has also fed the solarpunk stream. And Amsterdam\u2019s new solarpunk architectural projects include a designated speaker for the rights of the more-than-human world on its decision-making board, straight out of Starhawk\u2019sFifth Sacred Thing(we\u2019re getting there, people!)\n\nOn a more metaphysical level, the Potawatomi conservation biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer inBraiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants(2013) brought to the world stage the question of what \u2018becoming indigenous to a place\u2019 means, and linked activism with a grounded vision of the future. Solarpunk provides one vision fulfilling that promise by moving from an extractive disposable economy to a bioeconomy of composting, where materials are designed to return safely to soil instead of needing fire to melt, smelt or incinerate them back into use. One pop-culture glimpse of this appears in the filmTranscendence(2014), where Johnny Depp\u2019s character designs technologies that draw molecules from the environment to regenerate and self-repairafter he is uploaded to the internet.\n\nSolarpunk also has something in common with the cottagecore movement, which imagines an idealised collective pastoralism. Both cottagecore and solarpunk are committed to the beauty and at-homeness of living in a healthy, alive and playful ecology; such a society places care where it matters most. But while cottagecore looks back, solarpunk \u2013 today solidly under the umbrella of ecofuturism \u2013 looks ahead, presenting us with a constellation for the future with which we can experiment.\n\nAblutionby Thomas Chamberlain-Keen.

CourtesyThomas Chamberlain-Keen\n\nImagine a society where the goal is to develop our ecological intelligence, which feeds our emotional intelligence and vice versa in a virtuous loop. A society that ignites regeneration, where work and play become one, where we live close to the land (even if it\u2019s in a sky-touching arcology), because we have rewilded everywhere skin-in and-outwith the analytic intelligence of permaculture, agroecology and integrated pest management so that we find curated lushness wherever we live. As the researcher Adam Flynn put it in \u2018Solarpunk: Notes Towards a Manifesto\u2019 (2014): \u2018Solarpunk is a future with a human face and dirt behindits ears.\u2019\n\nOne of the most provocative ideas I\u2019ve been exposed to through solarpunk is the YouTuber Andrewism\u2019s notion that liberated forms of genetic engineering and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) could be used to create \u2018bioluminescent trees to light our streets\u2019 or \u2018bamboos as strong as steel\u2019, potentially working with, rather than against, the organisms we modify. (Getting consent from those organisms is another question that remains to be answered.) However, as Andrewism urges in the video \u2018How We Can Make Solarpunk a Reality\u2019 (2021): \u2018GMOs can only be solarpunk if they work to empower people and the environment, not corporations.\u2019",

As a plant philosopher, I\u2019ve researched their origin in support of pesticide sales and the billions spent by agribusiness to manufacture what I felt was a fake consensus around their safety. Nonetheless, I believe that, if we truly got to a solarpunk future with our technologies so integrated with nature, what it would mean to genetically modify an organism would itself change completely \u2013 maybe no genetic modification from our part would even be necessary if we just let the new ecologies we curate do the work of creation instead.\n\nA lush vertical neighbourhood where cables, roofs and balconies double as gardens \u2013 an improvised, nature-threaded cityscape. Note this rendering of solarpunk comes with a dinosaur in the streets (de-extinction) and a flying, steam-powered insect vehicle; digital illustration by the Chinese artist Trylea (aka Zhichao Cai). CourtesyZhichao Cai\n\nSolarpunk is about imagining what the world could look like if we used technology and labour to improve all lives, instead of concentrating wealth for the few. The aesthetic, which in some instances might feel lower tech than current technologies due to our mechanistic conditioning of what technology should look like, is about finding the local equilibrium of funky sustainability; and that requires freedom from the profit motive. In solarpunk, technology is yoked to the good life across interspecies contact, based on mutual aid, community flourishing and trust.\n\nRecently, a number of ecofuturist proposals have been put forth \u2013 but all seem to miss the solarpunk ideal. For instance, in 2017, Sidewalk Labs, Alphabet/Google\u2019s urban-innovation arm, explored a smart-tech approach for the Quayside waterfront project in Toronto, but it ran aground amid public backlash and political resistance. Rejecting the high-tech, sterile, sensor-filled Googlelandia, Toronto locals argued for a city shaped by democratic control and lived-in place, not corporate data-collection and optimisation. Many wanted a more organic urban experience that evoked a stronger sense of place, orterroir.\n\nAnother vision for the future is Saudi Arabia\u2019s planned new city Neom (from \u2018neo\u2019 + the Arabicmustaqbal, meaning \u2018new future\u2019). In its imagery, Neom comes closer to solarpunk than to Toronto\u2019s Quayside, but it still shies away. Envisioned as a1 trillionSaudi riyals($270 billion)linear megacity in the desert \u2013 with twin mirrored walls rising500 metres(1,600 feet)and stretching along some170 km(105 miles)\u2013 Neom would have capacity for9 millionpeople. It promises zero emissions, vertical farms, no cars and no pollution \u2013 notwithstanding the enormous material and ecological costs of constructing such a project. Backed by a sovereign wealth fund and driven from above, it borrows solarpunk\u2019s look more than its values. The difference isn\u2019t aesthetic; it\u2019s moral and political. In a project like Neom, scale comes first, and whatever stands in the way can be treated as collateral. In solarpunk, it\u2019s the non-negotiables that come first: consent, shared ownership, and a built world that can be maintained by the people who live in it. Solarpunk is based on composting and no waste: things are meant to last, be repaired, and return safely to the world when they\u2019re done. Building self-repair into tools undercuts planned obsolescence and the churn of replacement. Solarpunk\u2019s ingenuity assumes a steady-state economy that cools the fever dream of endless growth; Neom doubles downon it.\n\nThe contrast clarifies what many people are reaching for instead: a city that feels alive, not merely optimised. One emblem of that desire is the Toronto Tree Tower, a proposed low-tech high-rise wrapped in vegetation and natural materials, designed to bring nature back into the everyday fabric of the city. As its architects put it: \u2018We have enough steel, concrete and glass-towers in our cities.\u2019 They add that their tower \u2018tries to establish a direct connection to nature with plants and its natural materiality\u2019.",

            "text": "People want to live in cities for the vibrancy, the rambunctiousness, at times the chaos, not to be drones under a sterile but efficient dome. The vision includes not more cameras, but automated irrigation systems, fruit-picking from public fruit trees, mobile planter boxes and public areas so people can interact.\n\nSurveying the competing versions of the future on offer, it is easy to get dizzy. After all, part of the allure of solarpunk and other ecofuturist visions is that they offer an entwinement of humans and nature, and humans with humans, in partnership rather than domination. This sense of coming home, where the pain of separation is resolved, and where the excesses of the human psyche fall away in the loving embrace of nature\u2019s wonder or the smile of a neighbour, and a rock-solid feeling of \u2018enough\u2019 encapsulates the sense of sufficiency that solarpunk provides.\n\nIn its technological jiu-jitsu, solarpunk tries to flip the logic of industrialisation. It imagines a way of making things that work with living systems, instead of overriding them, turning production toward biophilic, cradle-to-cradle creation in sync with the rest of life. To do that, it embraces many technological traditions, in line with the thinking of the Hong Kong philosopher Yuk Hui\u2019s cosmotechnics: the idea that every culture\u2019s technical activity (techn\u0113) is grounded in a particular cosmology, its way of understanding and relating to the cosmos, nature and existence. As Western mechanical and digital technologies were globalised, they often eclipsed other ways of making and knowing; cosmotechnics pushes back against the idea of a single universal template, insisting that our technologies have always been multiple and diverse.\n\nSuch plurality is evident in the biomimicry Julia Watson documents around the world in her bookLo-TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism(2019). In Meghalaya, India, she describes the Khasi living root bridges, which are grown rather than built. In the marshlands of Iraq, she points to Ma\u2019dan reed architecture, where entire villages are made fromqasabreeds, and life rises and falls with the water level \u2013 an everyday symbiosis with flood and drought that adapts, and eventually decomposes, like the marsh itself. While solarpunk futures often stress the \u2018gee-whiz\u2019 factor of high tech integrated with nature, it is worth noticing that some of the most important technologies are the ones Western eyes failed to recogniseastechnologies precisely because they blend seamlessly into ecosystems. They may be exactly what we need to pass through the narrow neck of our current metacrisis.\n\nHonouring our emergence from and embeddedness in complex ecosystems removes the burden of coming up with all the technical solutions ourselves. Surrendering into what Buddhists callPrat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da, or interdependent co-arising, means cultivating our habitats by finding cultural practices that fit the situation; it also means that our technologies must hum to the tune of the ecologies around them, coming from renewable resources, and composting back into them. Making the best of our current tools is part of this great transition: taking a note from nature, we can morph them into longer-lasting, more robust, commons-oriented systems and, eventually, into biotechnics, or technologies that work with the organic order rather thanagainst it.\n\nIf it takes smart contracts to decentralise governance, blockchains to support public accountability, and reinventing the materials our physical environment is made from, so that people get what they actually want without overshooting planetary limits, so be it. Solarpunk welcomes an integrated view of nature and technology, treating them as intertwined rather than opposed. It imagines a cosmotechnics that acknowledges culturally and environmentally bespoke ways of making, and a biotechnics that treats design as symbiosis rather than domination. It redefines the territory of technology and nature, asking how we can use our tools to serve the living world, rather than the other way around. It promises a world based on mutual aid and solidarity, smilingly acknowledging the self-sabotage of gratuitous competition and scarcity.",
