            "text": "is professor of philosophy at Auburn University in Alabama, US. He is the author ofIdealizations in Physics(2023) and (with Michael Watkins)The Metaphysics of Color(2025), and the co-editor (with Insa Lawler and Kareem Khalifa) ofScientific Understanding and Representation: Modeling in the Physical Sciences(2023).\n\nEverything around you \u2013 from tables and trees to distant stars and the great diversity of animal and plant life \u2013 is built from a small set of elementary particles. According to established scientific theories, these particles fall into two basic and deeply distinct categories: bosons and fermions.\n\nBosons are sociable. They happily pile into the same quantum state, that is, the same combination of quantum properties such as energy level, like photons do when they form a laser. Fermions, by contrast, are the introverts of the particle world. They flat out refuse to share a quantum state with one another. This reclusive behaviour is what forces electrons to arrange themselves in layered atomic shells, ultimately giving rise to the structure of the periodic table and the rich chemistry it enables.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what we assumed. In recent years,evidencehas beenaccumulatingfor a third class of particles called \u2018anyons\u2019. Their name, coined by the Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek, gestures playfully at their refusal to fit into the standard binary of bosons and fermions \u2013 for anyons, anything goes. If confirmed, anyons wouldn\u2019t just add a new member to the particle zoo. They would constitute an entirely novel category \u2013 a new genus \u2013 that rewrites the rules for how particles move, interact, and combine. And those strange rules might one day engender new technologies.\n\nAlthough none of the elementary particles that physicists have detected are anyons, it is possible to engineer environments that give rise to them and potentially harness their power. We now think that some anyonswindaround one another, weaving paths that store information in a way that\u2019s unusuallyhardto disturb. That makes them promising candidates for building quantum computers \u2013 machines that could revolutionise fields like drugdiscovery, materialsscience, andcryptography. Unlike today\u2019s quantum systems that are easily disturbed, anyon-based designs may offer built-in protection andshowreal promise as building blocks for tomorrow\u2019s computers.\n\nPhilosophically, however, there\u2019s a wrinkle in the story. The theoretical foundations make it clear that anyons arepossibleonly in two dimensions, yet we inhabit a three-dimensional world. That makes them seem, in a sense, like fictions. When scientists seek to explore the behaviours of complicated systems, they use what philosopherscall\u2018idealisations\u2019, which can reveal underlying patterns by stripping away messy real-world details. But these idealisations may also mislead. If a scientific prediction depends entirely on simplification \u2013 if it vanishes the moment we take the idealisation away \u2013 that\u2019s a warning sign that something has gone wrong in our analysis.\n\nSo, if anyons are possible only through two-dimensional idealisations, what kind of reality do they actually possess? Are they fundamental constituents of nature, emergent patterns, or something in between? Answering these questions means venturing into the quantum world, beyond the familiar classes of particles, climbing among the loops and holes of topology, detouring into the strange physics of two-dimensional flatland \u2013 and embracing the idea that apparently idealised fictions can reveal deeper truths.\n\nBosons and fermions differ from one another in various ways. But if we want to understand anyons, the characteristic that interests us goes by the name of \u2018quantum statistics\u2019, which concerns the rules of engagement that dictate how particles behave when grouped together and distributed in single-particle states. Experimentally speaking, only two kinds of quantum statistics have been found so far \u2013 one for fermions and one for bosons. And each is defined by what happens when two identical particles swap places.",

            "text": "To unpack what this means, let\u2019s first consider a contrasting case. In classical physics, the state of the system is just the set of numbers for quantities like position and momentum that lets you predict how an object like a baseball will move next. Imagine a bucket of baseballs, then. You could label them Ball One, Ball Two, and so on. If Ball One is at the top of the bucket and Ball Two is at the bottom, that\u2019s one distinct arrangement. If you swap them, you have created a new, physically different arrangement. In classical physics, these two different situations correspond to two different states, and you can distinguish between them by observing how Ball Two and Ball One exchanged locations. In fact, you can \u2018tag\u2019 every classical particle \u2013 every baseball in our example \u2013 and follow its motion along a path.\n\nWhen you have a collection of particles, quantum mechanics doesn\u2019t describe them one by one. It assigns a quantum state to the entire system, which can take the form of a field-like entity known as a \u2018wavefunction\u2019 that expresses the probabilities associated with various observable processes. It encodes, for instance, all possible energies, momenta, positions and, importantly, how the particles populate the available single-particle states. You might think about single-particle states as describing one particle\u2019s possibilities, and the general state as describing all particles and their correlations.\n\nTake a system of identical particles like electrons, where the state is represented by a wavefunction. What is the relationship between the state of the system and another new state where we swapped the locations of particles One and Two? Is it like the baseballs in our bucket?\n\nHere\u2019s the rub. In quantum mechanics, unlike in classical physics, there is no experiment that can be conducted, and no observation that we can make, that will allow us to distinguish between these two systems. We can\u2019t \u2018tag\u2019 an electron and follow it along a path. Although quantum mechanics can represent these two situations differently, exchanging identical quantum particles can\u2019t change anything that you measure experimentally or observe, so our theoretical description of states should respect this symmetry. This idea is known as \u2018permutation invariance\u2019.\n\nMoreover, if permutation invariance implied that there are only two allowed behaviours of the quantum state when you swap identical particles, then there are only two kinds of quantum statistics \u2013 with only two corresponding classes of particles.\n\nThe standard story is as follows. Represent the state with a wavefunction and examine how it changes when we swap two particles as with the baseballs. Permutation invariance implies that this system\u2019s quantum state can be affected in only two ways. Either the swap leaves the wavefunction unchanged, giving us bosons, or it reverses its sign (from plus to minus or vice versa), producing fermions. Mathematically, this difference is tracked by a built-in multiplier \u2013 the plus or minus sign in our case \u2013 that records how the state responds to a particle swap. If this multiplier could take on different intermediate values, it would mean various particle classes, but the claim is that this marker can take only two forms. When you swap two identical bosons, the wavefunction appears exactly the same. It\u2019s like tossing two identical baseballs into the air and catching them in opposite hands \u2013 nobody watching can tell anything changed. If you swap two fermion baseballs, however, the wavefunction picks up a minus sign.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: that tidy textbook explanation rests on hidden assumptions. It assumes that swapping particles can only ever change the wavefunction by one simple kind of multiplier \u2013 plus or minus \u2013 and that swapping the same particles twice must always return you to the exact same state you started with. If you drop those assumptions, theoretically speaking, new possibilities open up. Now you can have other, more exotic kinds of particles \u2013 additional classes beyond bosons and fermions.",

            "text": "So far, we\u2019ve seen that particle classes depend on quantum statistics \u2013 the rules governing particle behaviour and distribution. Those rules hinge on how the wavefunction changes when identical particles swap, tracked by a built-in multiplier. The textbook argument claims only two multipliers are possible (+1 for bosons and -1 for fermions), but that conclusion rests on unwarranted hidden assumptions.\n\nThe key to understanding anyons lies in what happens, mathematically, when particles swap places \u2013 and how the space they move through shapes what\u2019s possible. To see how this opens the door to new particle types, we need a framework that treats the indistinguishability of identical particles not as a problem to work around, but as a fundamental constraint on the space where they live.\n\nConfiguration space is like a map, not of physical space, but where each point represents an arrangement of particles. Consider our bucket of baseballs. You could describe their position in three-dimensional physical space with coordinates on x, y, and z axes. For two baseballs, put each of their coordinates side by side and you have captured the arrangement. Add a third ball and you need more coordinates, and so on. Now imagine every possible arrangement (for whatever number of baseballs that you are interested in): that\u2019s configuration space.\n\nEnvision the configuration space of one particle to start. It will look just like a familiar three-dimensional space with the x, y, and z axes, since each point in configuration space represents a possible location that the particle may be in physical space.\n\nNext, we can represent the trajectory of a particle over time, its path in physical space, as a path in configuration space. Now we generalise: if one point in configuration space represents the positions in space of many particles, then paths through configuration space can signify how all of those particle positions change over time \u2013 the trajectories of particles.\n\nFor identical particles, we tidy up the space in various ways to respect permutation invariance (the principle that swapping identical particles produces no observable difference). This includes ruling out coordinates where two particles sit exactly on top of each other. If we imagine classical objects like baseballs, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense to say that two balls are in the same location. So, we cut those overlapping points out of configuration space \u2013 they form a kind of no-go zone, since they don\u2019t correspond to any physical possibility. In effect, they leave \u2018holes\u2019 in the map. And it turns out that such holes are also needed in the more subtle case of quantum particles to allow the possibility of multiple particle types.\n\nTo understand what these holes mean, we need to take a brief detour into a branch of mathematics called topology. This may seem abstract, but it\u2019s the key to seeing how anyons become possible, and how the structure of space itself can shape the categories of particle physics.\n\nTopology is the study of what stays the same when you stretch or twist without tearing. A doughnut and a coffee cup are \u2018the same\u2019 topologically because each has one hole \u2013 a doughnut through the middle, a cup through the handle \u2013 and you can imagine morphing one into the other like soft clay.\n\nNo doubt this is a bit counterintuitive since a doughnut and a coffee cup, while complementing each other wonderfully, are not, in fact, the same. But topology has to do with properties that remain unchanged when you deform a shape without cutting or breaking. In that sense, doughnuts, coffee cups, bagels, lifebuoys, wedding rings, bracelets, scrunchies, etc, are topologically equivalent. And they are topologically different from a figure-eight pretzel (which is, in turn, the same as a triple-loop belt buckle or a three-handled mug).",

            "text": "Loops \u2013 that is, closed paths \u2013 are a powerful way to detect holes, and they allow us to classify spaces in topology. If you can shrink down a loop to a point, and it doesn\u2019t get stuck on a hole, then the space has no hole. Topologically speaking, it\u2019s the simplest kind of space. The surface of a sphere is such an example.\n\nIf the loop gets caught, like a rubber band stuck around a donut, it reveals that a hole is there. From the perspective of topology, that\u2019s a more complex, richer space.\n\nMathematicians sort loops and spaces into types. In a space with no holes, all loops are topologically the same, since they shrink away. But in a space with holes, there are genuinely different kinds of loops that can\u2019t be undone. Topologically speaking, then, there are different classes of spaces depending on the holes and loops involved.\n\nThis is important to emphasise before continuing. The point of our detour into topology was to show that spaces with holes are topologically distinct \u2013 and that these differences can be used to classify spaces into different types. This is true of abstract mathematical spaces studied by a topologist, but it is also true of the configuration space of identical particles.\n\nWhen we\u2019re dealing with identical quantum particles, their configuration space \u2013 the abstract space of all possible arrangements \u2013 has holes. These holes represent the \u2018no go\u2019 zones. They affect how particles can move around one another. If you map out a path where two particles trade places, it forms a kind of loop in this space. Some of these loops can be undone, shrunk down until they disappear. Others get caught on the holes and can\u2019t be undone. They represent configuration spaces with a richer topology.\n\nOne of the key insights of this approach \u2013 the configuration space approach to permutation invariance \u2013 is that quantum statistics are shaped by which loops the space allows: the way these paths are grouped determines what kinds of exchanges are possible and, in turn, what kinds of quantum statistics the particles can have. In other words,the topology of configuration space determines quantum statistics with the corresponding particle type.\n\nLoops, then, are playing two roles at once. From a topological point of view, they help us classify spaces into ones that are topologically simple and ones that are more complex. From the perspectives of physics, when the space in question is the configuration space of identical particles, loops can correspond to particle exchanges (having to do with quantum statistics and particle class). So, a richer topology in configuration space, with more kinds of non-shrinkable loops, corresponds to more distinct ways particles can be swapped. And that is precisely what opens the door to different forms of quantum statistics and new particle kinds.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly take stock. Particle class \u2013 that is, bosons, fermions or something more exotic \u2013 goes hand in hand with quantum statistics \u2013 the rules governing how such particles interact and occupy single-particle states \u2013 which depends on how the system\u2019s quantum state, or wavefunction, changes when identical particles swap. That is, on the built-in marker that it picks up when particles are exchanged. Permutation invariance is the principle that swapping identical quantum particles makes no observable difference, so the theory must treat those exchanged states as equivalent in some sense. What the configuration-space approach does is build permutation invariance straight into the space that describes all possible arrangements of particles and their trajectories. In doing so, the topological shape of the configuration space itself \u2013 the holes and permitted loops \u2013 constrains how quantum states may change when particles are swapped.

            "text": "According to the configuration-space approach, quantum statistics are determined by the topology of configuration space. A richer topology means more possibilities for statistics and, correspondingly, particle type. So, what happens mathematically when we swap particles?\n\nJust like we explored earlier, this approach says that if you swap identical particles in three dimensions, the built-in multiplier that the wavefunction picks up is either a plus or a minus sign. The topology of configuration space is rich enough to give you two kinds of quantum statistics: one for bosons and one for fermions. But things get more interesting when you move to two dimensions because, topologically speaking, configuration space in two dimensions is richer.\n\nRecall that we can classify topological spaces according to which loop can be shrunk to a point without getting stuck. Imagine a cube with a hole in it (as our candidate space of interest). In three dimensions, you can always slip off the loop into the third dimension and make it vanish.\n\nFlatten the world and the story changes. In two dimensions, loops can get caught around holes, which means that we are dealing with a space that is topologically richer. We\u2019ve moved from a space that is simple, where all loops can be shrunk to a point (despite the hole), to one that is more complex.\n\nIn a flat world, the built-in multiplier that marks an exchange isn\u2019t stuck with only two settings \u2013 plus or minus \u2013 it can take on intermediate values. These intermediate values signify novel rules for particle behaviour and distribution, that is, different quantum statistics. In two dimensions, the way in which particles wind around one another can tune that multiplier \u2013 sometimes just by how much and which way they wind, and in some systems even by order of moves, leaving a \u2018memory\u2019 of how the motion unfolded. When that happens, the system\u2019s description after an exchange isn\u2019t boson-like or fermion-like \u2013 it\u2019s something new: anyons.\n\nWe\u2019ve now seen how anyons can emerge in theory, but theory alone isn\u2019t reality. Our world is three dimensional, which means two-dimensional configuration spaces are idealisations of sorts. Changing the analogy from baseballs to the flat game of pool, it\u2019s like pretending billiard balls can only ever roll across the table, even though we know a ball can always pop up off the surface.\n\nThis raises the question: anyons live in flatland, in a simplified, two-dimensional world. Can they survive in the full three dimensions of reality? Despite all the experimental buzz and theoretical interest, there are reasons to worry that anyons might not be realafter all.\n\nTo see why, imagine relaxing the idealisation just a little. Think of a series of three-dimensional boxes, each one flatter than the last. The width and length stay the same, but the height gradually shrinks \u2013 getting closer and closer to a flat, two-dimensional sheet. That\u2019s our candidate anyon setup:\n\nPut a forbidden spot in the middle to stand for the places identical particles aren\u2019t allowed to occupy; in our picture, that acts like a hole in configuration space:\n\nAs you squash down the box to zero height, you get a perfectly flat square. Now, walk a loop around the hole. In flatland, that loop can\u2019t be shrunk down to a point, it gets stuck on the hole. This points to a configuration space of identical particles that is topologically rich enough to support anyons.\n\nBut add just a sliver of third dimension, and everything changes. Now you can lift up the loop and shrink it down. This means that, despite the hole, the topology of the space is too simple for anyons. The difference between two and three dimensions isn\u2019t gradual; it\u2019s all or nothing. Either you\u2019re flat enough for anyons to exist, or you\u2019re not. There\u2019s noin between.",

            "text": "That\u2019s the warning sign. As soon as we add even a little depth, the structure that makes anyons possible disappears. We seem to be left, then, with three choices.\n\nFirst, maybe anyons aren\u2019t real in a deep sense. For instance, some philosophers havearguedthat so-called \u2018paraparticles\u2019 \u2013 a wholeotherclass of particles \u2013 are really nothing more than bosons and fermions in disguise. By the same reasoning, one could argue that anyons are simply familiar particles dressed up with extra labels. The difference lies in the notation, not in the physics. Mathematically, for the simpler cases, that might be enough. But in the more complex cases, in which particle paths wind around each other leaving a lasting memory on the system, it\u2019s much harder to dismiss the new behaviour as mere convention.\n\nAlternatively, then, maybe we need a newframeworkthat captures the strange behaviour without relying on a structure that evaporates the instant we lift into the third dimension. If experiments definitively confirm the existence of anyons, perhaps there\u2019s another way to explain them that doesn\u2019t rely so heavily on the topological quirks of idealised, flat spaces.\n\nPerhaps some real systems make the idealisation come true by locking motion strictly into two dimensions. Think ultra-thin, engineered layers where particles are confined so tightly that moving out of plane isn\u2019t just unlikely, it\u2019s physically off limits. In that case, we\u2019re not merely idealising; we\u2019re building genuine flatlands in the lab. The particles don\u2019t just behave as if they live in a two-dimensional world \u2013 they actually do. And when that happens, fiction becomes fact.\n\nIn 1982, physicists studying ultra-thin materials made a surprisingdiscovery. Under strong magnetic fields and extreme cold, electrons in these materials stopped behaving like individual particles and started acting in unison, forming strange states that seemed to carry only a fraction of an electron\u2019s charge. This was the fractional quantum Hall effect, aphenomenonso unexpected and puzzling that it earned Daniel Tsui, Horst St\u00f6rmer and Robert Laughlin the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1998. To make sense of it, researchersproposedthat the ripples of charge in these flat, layered materials might be behaving like anyons. That idea stuck, and flat, ultra-thin systems became the natural hunting ground. Over time, hints of anyon-like behaviour showed up in other exotic materials too,likequantum spin liquids.\n\nSo, if anyons exist, what kind of existence is it? None of the elementary particles are anyons. Instead, physicists appeal to the notion of \u2018quasiparticles\u2019, in which large numbers of electrons or atoms interact in complex ways and behave, collectively, like a simpler object you can track with novel behaviours.\n\nPicture fans doing \u2018the wave\u2019 in a stadium. The wave travels around the arena as if it\u2019s a single thing, even though it\u2019s really just people standing and sitting in sequence. In a solid, the coordinated motion of many particles can act the same way \u2013 forming a ripple or disturbance that moves as if it were its own particle. Sometimes, the disturbance centres on an individual particle, like an electron trying to move through a material. As it bumps into nearby atoms and other electrons, they push back, creating a kind of \u2018cloud\u2019 around it. The electron plus its cloud behave like a single, heavier, slower particle with new properties. That whole package is also treated as a quasiparticle.\n\nSome quasiparticles behave like bosons or fermions. But for others, when two of them trade places, the system\u2019s quantum state picks up a built-in marker that isn\u2019t limited to the two familiar settings. It can take on intermediate values, which means novel quantum statistics. If the theories describing these systems are right, then the quasiparticles in question aren\u2019t just behaving oddly, they are anyons: the third type of particles.",

In this sense, anyons have been experimentally confirmed. But there are different kinds of anyons, and there is still active work being done on the more exotic anyons that we hope to harness for quantum computers.\n\nBut even so, are quasiparticles, like anyons, really real? That depends. Some philosophersarguethat existence depends on scale. Zoom in close enough, and it makes little sense to talk about tables or trees \u2013 those objects show up only at the human scale. In the same way, some particles exist only in certain settings. Anyons don\u2019t appear in the most fundamental theories, but they show up in thin, flat systems where they are the stable patterns that help explain real, measurable effects. From this point of view, they\u2019re as real as anything else we use to explain the world.\n\nOthers take a more radical stance. Theyarguethat quasiparticles, fields and even elementary particles aren\u2019t truly real: they\u2019re just useful labels. What really exists is not stuff but structure: relations and patterns. So \u2018anyons\u2019 are one way we track the relevant structure when a system is effectively two-dimensional.\n\nQuestions about reality take us deep into philosophy, but they also open the door to a broader enquiry: what does the story of anyons reveal about the role of idealisations and fictions in science? Why bother playing inflatlandat all?\n\nOften, idealisations are seen as nothing more than shortcuts. They strip away details to make the mathematics manageable, or serve as teaching tools to highlight the essentials, but they aren\u2019t thought to play a substantive role in science. On this view, they\u2019re conveniences, not engines of discovery.\n\nBut the story of anyons shows that idealisations can do far more. They open up new possibilities, sharpen our understanding of theory, clarify what a phenomenon is supposed to be in the first place, and sometimes even point the way to new science and engineering.\n\nThe first payoff is possibility: idealisation lets us explore a theory\u2019s \u2018what ifs\u2019, the range of behaviours it allows even if the world doesn\u2019t exactly realise them. When we move to two dimensions, quantum mechanics suddenly permits a new kind of particle choreography. Not just a simple swap, but wind-and-weave novel rules for how particles can combine and interact. Thinking in this strictly two-dimensional setting is not a parlour trick. It\u2019s a way to see what the theory itself makes possible.\n\nThat same detour through flatland also assists us in understanding the theory better. Idealised cases turn up the contrast knobs. In three dimensions, particle exchanges blur into just two familiar options of bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, the picture sharpens. By simplifying the world, the idealisation makes the theory\u2019s structure visible to thenaked eye.\n\nIdealisation also helps us pin down what a phenomenon really is. It separates difference-makers from distractions. In the anyon case, the flat setting reveals what would count as a genuine signature, say, a lasting memory of the winding of particles, and what would be a mere lookalike that ordinary bosons or fermions could mimic. It also highlights contrasts with other theoretical possibilities: paraparticles, for example, don\u2019t depend on a two-dimensional world, but anyons seem to. That contrast helps identify what belongs to the essence of anyons and what does not. When we return to real materials, we know what to look for and what to ignore.\n\nFinally, idealisations don\u2019t just help us read a theory \u2013 they help write the next one. If experiments keep turning up signatures that seem to exist only in flatland, then what began as an idealisation becomes a compass for discovery. A future theory must build that behaviour into its structure as a genuine, non-idealised possibility. Sometimes, that means showing how real materials effectively enforce the ideal constraint, such as true two-dimensionality. Other times, it means uncovering a new mechanism that reproduces the same exchange behaviour without the fragile assumptions of perfect flatness. In both cases, idealisation serves as a guide for theory-building. It tells us which features must survive, which can bend, and where to look for the next, more general theory.",
