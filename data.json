This timeline is a visual representation of world history, spanning from 4004 BCE to 1881 CE. Courtesy theDavid Rumsey Map Collection\n\nis professor of philosophy at Durham University, UK. Her scholarly books includeAbsolute Time: Rifts in Early Modern British Metaphysics(2018),Victoria Welby(2023) andReal Time: A Reinvention in British Metaphysics 1883-1928(forthcoming). She has also written a trade book,The Meaning of Travel: Philosophers Abroad(2020).\n\n\u2018It\u2019s natural,\u2019 says the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \u2018to think that time can be represented by a line.\u2019 We imagine the past stretching in a line behind us, the future stretching in an unseen line ahead. We ride an ever-moving arrow \u2013 the present. However, this picture of time isnotnatural. Its roots stretch only to the18th century,yet this notion has now entrenched itself so deeply in Western thought that it\u2019s difficult to imagine time as anything else. And this new representation of time has affected all kinds of things, from our understanding of history to time travel.\n\nLet\u2019s journey back to ancient Greece. Amid rolls of papyrus and purplish figs, philosophers like Plato looked up into the night. His creation myth,Timaeus, connected time with the movements of celestial bodies. The god \u2018brought into being\u2019 the sun, moon and other stars, for the \u2018begetting of time\u2019. They trace circles in the sky, creating days, months, years. The \u2018wanderings\u2019 of other, \u2018bewilderingly numerous\u2019 celestial bodies also make time. When all their wanderings are \u2018completed together\u2019, they achieve \u2018consummation\u2019 in a \u2018perfect year\u2019. At the end of this \u2018Great Year\u2019, all the heavenly bodies will have completed their cycles, returning to where they started. Taking millennia, this will complete one cycle of the universe. As ancient Greek philosophy spread through Europe, these ideas of time spread too. For instance, Greek and Roman Stoics connected time with their doctrine of \u2018Eternal Recurrence\u2019: the universe undergoes infinite cycles, ending and restarting in fire.\n\nSuch views of time arecyclical: time comprises a repeating cycle, as events occur, pass, and occur again. They echo processes in nature. Day and night. Summer to winter. As the historian Stephen Jay Gould explains inTime\u2019s Arrow, Time\u2019s Cycle(1987), within the West, cyclical conceptions dominated ancient thought. It\u2019s even hinted at in the Bible. For example,Ecclesiastesproclaims: \u2018What has been will be again \u2026 there is nothing new under the sun.\u2019 Yet, Gould writes, the Bible also contains alinearconception of time: time comprises a one-way sequence of unrepeatable events. Take Biblical history: \u2018God creates the earth once, instructs Noah to ride out a unique flood in a singular ark.\u2019 Gould describes this linear understanding of history as an \u2018important and distinctive\u2019 contribution of Jewish thought. Biblical history helped power linear ideas of time.\n\nCyclical and linear conceptions of time thrived side by side for centuries, sometimes blurring into one another. After all, we live through natural, cyclical seasonsandunrepeatable events \u2013 birth, first marriage, death. Importantly, medievals and early moderns didn\u2019tliterallysee cyclical time as a circle, or linear time as a line. Yet in the 19th-century world of frock coats, petticoats and suet puddings, change was afoot. Gradually, the linear model of time gained ground, and thinkers literally began drawing time as a line. To explain how, Ipointto four key developments.\n\nFirst:chronography, the art of representing historical events. Historians have always struggled with how to best display events on a page, and since ancient times a popular solution lay in \u2018time tables\u2019: grids displaying dates.\n\nA crucial innovation lay in the invention of \u2018timelines\u2019. As Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton detail in their coffee-table gorgeousCartographies of Time(2010), the \u2018modern form\u2019 of the timeline, \u2018with a single axis and a regular, measured distribution of dates\u2019, came into existence around the mid-18th century. In 1765, the scientist-philosopher Joseph Priestley, best known for co-discovering oxygen, invented what was arguably the world\u2019s first modern timeline.",

            "text": "On hisAChart of Biography(1765), time flows from left to right, from1200 BCEto (what was then) the present. More than 2,000 miniature lines painstakingly plot the durations of people\u2019s lives, including the likes of Cicero, QueenElizabeth I,and Isaac Newton. Because hismethod of representing time using lines was so novel, Priestley felt moved tojustify it:\n\nRosenberg and Grafton describeA Chart of Biographyas \u2018path-breaking\u2019, a \u2018watershed\u2019. \u2018Within very few years, variations on Priestley\u2019s charts began to appear just about everywhere \u2026 and, over the course of the19th century,envisioning history in the form of a timeline became second nature.\u2019 Priestley\u2019s influence was widespread. For example, William Playfair, the inventor of line graphs and bar charts, singled out Priestley\u2019s timeline as a predecessor of his own work. Rosenberg and Grafton explain that, over the next50 years,Playfair\u2019s line graph, which used one axis for time, and another for economic measures such as exports, \u2018became one of the most recognisable chronographic forms\u2019. By the time of Charles Dickens, timelines were common across books, posters, newspapers.\n\nThe second key development concernsevolution. During the early19th century,scientists created linearandcyclical models of evolutionary processes. For example, the geologist Charles Lyell hypothesised that the evolution of species might track repeatable patterns upon Earth. This led to his memorable claim that, following a \u2018cycle of climate\u2019, the \u2018pterodactyle might flit again through the air.\u2019 However, with the work of Charles Darwin, cyclical models faded. HisOn theOrigin of Species(1859) conceives of evolution in linear terms. It literally includes diagrams depicting species\u2019 evolution over time using splaying, branching lines. These diagrams assume a linear model of time: time runs in a linear, vertical fashion from the past at the bottom of the page to the present at the top. Gould describes Darwinian evolution as a linear \u2018arrow\u2019 in the \u2018fullest sense\u2019: \u2018a quirky sequence of intricate, unique, unrepeatable events\u2019.\n\nThe third key development emerged in the 1870s:chronophotography. This new art form captured motion through successive images. Chronophotography seems to spatialise time by portraying a temporal process, such as a horse\u2019s gallop, spread out across the page. In his landmark bookLe Mouvement(1894), the photographer \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey opens with a statement that could be drawn directly from Priestley: \u2018Time \u2026 can be represented in a graphic form by straight lines of various lengths.\u2019\n\nThe last development stemmed from mathematics: theories of thefourth dimension. Humans perceive three spatial dimensions: length, width, and depth. But mathematicians have long theorised there were more. In the 1880s, the mathematician Charles Hinton popularised these ideas, and went further. He didn\u2019t just argue that space has a fourth dimension, he identified timewiththat dimension. Hinton argued that, because of the limitations of human consciousness, we perceive four-dimensional objects as changing three-dimensional objects. Yet reality is really an unchanging, four-dimensional space. What we perceive as time is misperceived space. The world is a \u2018stupendous whole, wherein all that has ever come into being or will come co-exists\u2019. Hinton doesn\u2019t describe time as a line but, implicitly, describing time asadimension of space means that, if time were taken by itself, it would be a line. Hinton\u2019s work was speedily absorbed into the 19th-century air, and soon other 1880s thinkers were identifying the fourth dimension of space with time.\n\nBy the late 19th century, representing time as a line was not just widespread \u2013 it wasnatural. Like today, it would have been hard to imagine how else we could represent time. And this affected how people understood the world.\n\nWithin history, conceiving of time as a line helped to fuel the notion that humanity is making progress. Joseph Priestley, our timeline inventor, is partly responsible for this. The man once listed inventions that have made people happier, including flour mills, linen, clocks, and window glass. HisChart of Biographyevidenced this positive take on human progress. It places figures into groups, such as \u2018Artists & Poets\u2019, \u2018Mathematicians & Physicians\u2019, \u2018Divines and Metaphysicians\u2019. If you look back to hisChart, you\u2019ll see that, as time goes on, increasing numbers of these figures appear. This confirmed Priestley\u2019s belief that humanity is improving.",

            "text": "For Victorians, belief in progress only grew, impelled by rapid scientific and technological development. Victorians saw the invention of railway systems, light bulbs, telegraphs, typewriters, fridges, telephones. The historian Thomas Macaulay claimed: \u2018The history of England is emphatically the history of progress.\u2019 Such narratives received further support via the ideas of Darwinian evolution.\n\nDarwin\u2019s evolutionary diagrams resemble trees with forking branches. As the historian of science Peter Bowler explains, this rightly implies that \u2018evolution has no main line and hence no particular goal\u2019: \u2018The human race is not the inevitable end-product of animal evolution, but an unusual species formed by a unique combination of circumstances forced upon its ancestors.\u2019 Nonetheless, Darwin made sure thatOn theOrigin of Speciescould be interpreted as progressivist. For example, the bookbluntly states that life forms \u2018tend to progress towards perfection\u2019. Victorians took this on board, cheerfully incorporating evolution into their broader story of progress. Darwinian evolution was portrayed not as a many-branched tree, but as an arrow: over time, species evolved in a line from less perfect to more perfect.\n\nWithin philosophy, conceiving of time as a line led to thinkers debating the reality of the past and future. Picture a line: all its parts, the fractions of ink that make it up, exist. When we picture timeasa line, this leads us to think that all its parts exist too. In the 1870s, the German philosopher Hermann Lotze became anxious about this. \u2018We speak of Time as a line, but,\u2019 he writes, \u2018the conception of a line involves that of a reality belonging equally to all its elements. Time however does not correspond to this.\u2019 For Lotze, if time were a line, it would only \u2018possess one real point\u2019: \u2018the present\u2019.\n\nEarly 20th-century philosophy saw major debates emerge over the reality of the past and future. In my view, these debates were triggered by the new idea that time is a line. On one side of these stood the likes of Lotze, who argued that only the present exists.Henri Bergsonalso argued for the unreality of the future, attacking the linear conception of time. His very first book,Time and Free Will(1889), argues vehemently that \u2018time isnota line\u2019 (my emphasis). Amusingly, in the English translation of this book, the index entry for \u2018Line\u2019 provides page references to \u2018time not a\u2019. Later, Bergson\u2019sCreative Evolution(1907) attacks the new arts of chronophotography and cinematography, for failing to capture the true nature of time. The Frenchman writes: \u2018Of the gallop of a horse our eye perceives chiefly a characteristic, essential \u2026 form.\u2019 In contrast, \u2018instantaneous photography\u2019 spatially \u2018spreads out\u2019 the horse\u2019s gallop, portraying mere \u2018quantitativevariations\u2019. The naked eye captures theformof a horse\u2019s gallop in a way that photography cannot.\n\nOn the other side of this debate stood the likes of the British philosopherVictoria Welby, who drew on chronophotography and the fourth dimension to argue that time isliterallyspace. The past is as real as a piece of land we\u2019ve just journeyed through, the future as real as the country waiting \u2018below a given horizon\u2019. Similarly,Bertrand Russellargued: \u2018Past and future must be acknowledged to be as real as the present.\u2019 Evoking new art forms, Russell proudly describes his view as \u2018cinematographic\u2019. His peer Samuel Alexander also argued for the reality of past, present and future, and offers a similarly cinematographic theory. If we could properly see the world, Alexander argues, we would see that past events do not \u2018vanish\u2019. They have merely \u2018moved back upon the film\u2019. Our present is merely further forwards on the reel of film that is reality.\n\nOf course, the best development produced by conceiving of time as a line was timetravel. People had imagined visiting the past or future in one way or another for centuries \u2013 by dreams, or visions \u2013 butH G Wellsgave it a whole new, scientific spin. His novelTheTime Machine(1895) drew directly on Hinton\u2019s \u2018fourth dimension\u2019 to explainhowwe can travel in time. As his fictional time-travellerputs it:",

One critic dubbed Wells the \u2018literary pioneer of time travel\u2019.\n\nToday, conceiving of time as a line remains widespread. Timelines are everywhere: in the history of evolution, the history of video games, and the history of chocolate. There\u2019s even atimelineof timelines. And the effects of this line of thought (pun intended) are still with us. Philosophers continue to debate the reality of past and future: just check out this bumper encyclopaedia article on \u2018Presentism\u2019, \u2018the view that only present things exist\u2019. Time-travel stories run rife.Back to the Future. Groundhog Day. The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife. Historians have largely dropped Victorian faith in the progress of humanity, yet progress stories about particular areas remain. For example, take thistimeline: it straightforwardly depicts technological progress over time. All these ideas are powered by the notion that time is a line.
