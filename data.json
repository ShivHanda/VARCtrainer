            "text": "Some people seem driven more by what they oppose, reject and hate than by what they promote, affirm and revere. Their political commitments, personal identities and emotional lives appear to be structured more by opposition, resentment and hostility than by a positive set of ideals or aspirations.\n\nTucker Carlson, a prominent Right-wing television host and former Fox News anchor, has no shortage of enemies. On his shows, he has condemned gender-neutral pronouns, immigrants, the removal of Confederate statues, mainstream media, the FBI and CIA, globalism, paper straws, big tech, foreign aid, school curricula, feminism, gingerbread people, modern art \u2013 and the list goes on. Each item is presented as an existential threat or a sign of cultural decay. Even when conservatives controlled the White House and the US Senate, he presented those like him as under siege. Victories never brought relief, only more enemies, more outrage, more reasons to stay aggrieved.\n\nIn April 2025, Donald Trump took the stage to mark the 100th day of his second term as US president. You might have expected a moment of triumph. He had reclaimed the presidency, consolidated power within the Republican Party, and issued a vast range of executive orders. But the mood wasn\u2019t celebratory. It was combative. Trump spent most of his time attacking his predecessor Joe Biden, repeating false claims about the 2020 election, denouncing the press, and warning of threats posed by immigrants, \u2018radical Left lunatics\u2019 and corrupt elites. The tone was familiar: angry, aggrieved, unrelenting. Even in victory, the focus was on enemies and retribution.\n\nThis dynamic isn\u2019t unique to the United States. Leaders like Narendra Modi in India, Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil havebuilt movementsthat thrive on perpetual grievance. Even after consolidating power, they continue to cast their nations as under siege \u2013 from immigrants, intellectuals, journalists or cultural elites. The rhetoric remains combative, the mood aggrieved.\n\nFigures like Carlson and Trump don\u2019t pivot from grievance to resolution. Victory doesn\u2019t bring peace, grace or reconciliation. Instead, they remain locked in opposition. Their energy, their meaning, even their identity, seem to depend on having an endless list of enemies to fight.\n\nSo there\u2019s an interesting dynamic: certain individuals and movements seem geared toward perpetual opposition. When one grievance is corrected, another is found. When one enemy is defeated, another is sought. What explains this perpetual need for enemies?\n\nSome people adopt this stance tactically: they recognise that opposition and condemnation can attract a large following, so they produce outrage or encourage grievance as a way of generating attention. Perhaps it\u2019s all an act: what they really want, what they really care about, is maximising the number of social media followers, building brands or getting elected. But this can\u2019t be a full explanation. Even if certain people adopt this tactical stance, their followers don\u2019t: they appear genuinely gripped by anger and condemnation. And not all leaders appear to be calculating and strategic: Trump\u2019s outrage is genuine.\n\nThis pattern of endless denunciation and grievance has been noticed by many scholars. As a recentstudyputs it, \u2018grievance politics revolves around the fuelling, funnelling, and flaming of negative emotions such as fear or anger.\u2019 But what makes this oppositional stance appealing? If it\u2019s not just strategic posturing, what explains it? We can begin answering that question by distinguishing two ways that movements or orientations can be oppositional.\n\nSometimes, movements face a vast set of obstacles and opponents. Take the protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and \u201970s. This movement had a clear goal: ending US involvement in Vietnam. It lasted for more than a decade and unfolded across multiple fronts, which ranged from marches to acts of civil disobedience to teach-ins to draft resistance. Participants faced real costs: jail time, government surveillance, public backlash, even violence. The targets of opposition shifted over time \u2013 from the Lyndon B Johnson administration, to Richard Nixon, to Gerald Ford. The tactics evolved: from letter-writing campaigns to draft-card burnings, mass marches, lobbying from wounded veterans, and testimony from grieving families. Nonetheless, this was a movement that aimed at a concrete goal. Opposition was necessary, but it was a means to an end. The focus remained on the goal, rather than on sustaining conflict for its own sake.",

            "text": "The anti-apartheid movement offers another example. For decades, activists fought to dismantle a specific political system in South Africa. The struggle demanded great sacrifice and long-term opposition, but these efforts were tethered to a definite goal. Once that goal was achieved, the movement largely dissolved. Its antagonism had a purpose and, when that purpose was fulfilled, the opposition faded.\n\nThe Vietnam War protests and the anti-apartheid movements both involved forms of opposition and grievance, but their antagonism was in the service of positive goals. The movements discussed above \u2013 those led by Carlson, Trump, Orb\u00e1n and so on \u2013 are very different. Their energy, coherence and sense of identity seem to depend on opposition itself. Grievance animates their followers; hostility to enemies becomes central to how they think, feel and see themselves. Without enemies, the movement would unravel.\n\nThese examples indicate that hostility, anger and opposition don\u2019t necessarily make a movement problematic. On the contrary, they can be signs of moral concern, legitimate reactions to the fact that something precious is being threatened. As Martha Nussbaum has argued, anger can play anessential rolein democratic life by expressing moral concern and galvanising collective action. Iris Marion Young hasmadesimilar points, showing how opposition can affirm shared values. And in 1968 Martin LutherKing Jrclaimed that \u2018the supreme task is to organise and unite people so that their anger becomes a transforming force.\u2019But there\u2019s a difference between opposition that aims to realise a shared good, and opposition that is pursued for its own sake. Some movements use opposition as ameansto build something they value. Others make opposition itself the point. That\u2019s the distinction I want to highlight: between what I callcontingently negativeandconstitutively negativeorientations. Contingently negative movements treat opposition as a means to a positive end, a way of building something better. Constitutively negative movements are different: what\u2019s essential is the continuous expression of hostility, rather than the attainment of any particular goal.\n\nGrievance politics involves a constitutively negative orientation. That\u2019s what sets it apart from liberatory movements, struggles to realise ideals, or efforts to defend cherished values. If you value something, you\u2019ll be disturbed by threats to it. You\u2019ll be sensitive to people who might undermine it, and you may be moved to defend it. That\u2019s normal. That\u2019s part of what it is to value anything at all. But constitutively negative orientations are different. Values are just pretexts for expressing hostility. If one value is secured, we just need a new outlet and a new justification for hostility. The driving need is not to protect or preserve, but to oppose.\n\nBut why would anyone be drawn to a constitutively negative orientation? Why are these orientations so gripping? The answer is simple: they deliver powerful psychological and existential rewards. Psychologically, they transform inward pain to outward hostility, offer a feeling of elevated worth, and transform powerlessness into righteousness. Existentially, they provide a sense of identity, community and purpose.\n\nTo see how this works, we need to distinguish between emotions and emotional mechanisms. Emotions like anger, hatred, sadness, love and fear are familiar. But emotional mechanisms are subtler and often go unnoticed. They are not individual emotions; they\u2019re psychological processes that transform one emotional state into another. They take one set of emotions as input and produce a different set of emotions as output.\n\nHere\u2019s a familiar example: it\u2019s hard to keep wanting something that you know you can\u2019t have. If you desperately want something and can\u2019t get it, you will experience frustration, unease, perhaps envy; you may even feel like a failure. In light of this, there\u2019s psychological pressure to transform frustration and envy into dismissal and rejection. The teenager who can\u2019t make it onto the soccer team convinces himself that athletes are just dumb jocks. Or, you\u2019re filled with envy when you scroll through photos of exotic vacations and gleaming houses, but you reassure yourself that only superficial people want these things \u2013 your humble home is all that you really want.",

            "text": "There\u2019s a similar mechanism that transforms humiliation and low self-worth into a form of spiteful hatred. Philosophers call thisressentiment \u2013a French word for resentment, but with a twist. It names not just a passing feeling, but a deeper emotional mechanism, one that transmutes pain, powerlessness and humiliation into condemnation. In the late19th century,Friedrich Nietzscheargued thatressentimentis the emotional mechanism behind many of our values. Modern \u2018morality begins\u2019, Nietzsche wrote inOn the Genealogy of Morality(1887), \u2018whenressentimentitself becomes creative and gives birth to values.\u2019 Since then, a range of thinkers have traced the way thatressentimentshapes social and political life. As Wendy Browndescribesit,ressentimentis a \u2018triple achievement: it produces an affect (rage, righteousness) that overwhelms the hurt, it produces a culprit responsible for the hurt, and it produces a site of revenge to displace the hurt \u2026\u2019 Put simply,ressentimentis an emotional mechanism that transforms feelings of worthlessness or humiliation into vindictive feelings of superiority, rancour and blame.\n\nWe can see how this plays out in individual lives. Imagine someone who grows up in a declining rural town. She dreams of escape, fantasising about the vibrant lives she sees portrayed in cities, lives full of culture, opportunity, wealth and success. As the years go on, the dream seems unattainable. Jobs are scarce, advancement elusive, and nothing in her life resembles what she once imagined. Frustrated and unhappy, she feels like a failure in life. But then she encounters grievance-filled populist rhetoric. The people she once admired and envied \u2013 the people she now identifies as the urban elite \u2013 are cast as the cause of her suffering. They are selfish, out of touch, morally corrupt, and hostile to her way of life. What once seemed like an image of the good life now appears as injustice. And, rather than focusing on specific policy proposals for correcting structural economic injustices, she becomes energised by condemnation and hostility.\n\nOr picture another person, a lonely man who watches others form friendships, build relationships, and move easily through social spaces, while he remains on the margins. He feels isolated, sad, alone. One day he stumbles into a corner of the internet that offers an explanation: the problem isn\u2019t him, it\u2019s the world. Reading incel websites, he comes to believe that feminism, social norms and cultural hypocrisy have made genuine connection impossible for someone like him. In time, he internalises this story. His disappointment becomes a source of pride, a mark of insight. His sadness transforms into anger. He has enemies to rail against and grievances to voice.\n\nThese cases differ in an interesting way: the economic case involves a real form of structural injustice, whereas the incel case involves an ideology that invents a grievance. But notice that beyond this difference, there\u2019s a similar emotional arc. A person starts out with a positive vision of the good. But their life is full of hardship, disappointment and despair. Initially, they might blame themselves. And that\u2019s painful. It\u2019s hard to sit in one\u2019s own pain, feeling responsible for it, feeling like a failure. It\u2019s especially hard when you see other people enjoying the life that you wishyou had.\n\nIn time, these people encounter a narrative that redirects the blame. Their unhappiness isn\u2019t their own fault, it\u2019s the fault of someone else. They are being treated unfairly, unjustly; they are being attacked, oppressed or undermined. This kind of story is seductive. It offers release from feelings of diminished self-worth. It offers a way to deflect pain, assign blame and recast oneself as a victim. It also offers a community of like-minded peers who reinforce this story. What emerges is a kind of negative solidarity: bound together through animosity, they attack or disparage an outgroup. The individual now belongs to a group of people who share outrage and recognise the same enemies.

            "text": "As the 20th-century thinkers Ren\u00e9 Girard and Mircea Eliade remind us, opposition can do more than divide \u2013 it can bind. Girard saw how communities forge unity through a common enemy, channelling their fears and frustrations onto scapegoats. This shared act of condemnation offers not just relief, but belonging. Eliade, approaching these points from a different angle, examined our yearning to fold personal suffering into a larger, morally charged drama. Grievance politics draws on both patterns. It doesn\u2019t just vent rage; it weaves pain into a story. It offers a script in which hardship becomes injustice, and outrage becomes identity.\n\nThese patterns aren\u2019t just speculative. Scholars have traced how pain, disappointment and a sense of failure can be transfigured into grievance \u2013 how personal frustration becomes political identity. In her work on rural Wisconsin, Katherine Cramershowshow economic stagnation can give rise to resentment toward urban elites. Arlie Russell Hochschild, drawing on interviews in Louisiana,describesa \u2018deep story\u2019 in which people feel passed over, displaced, left behind. Kate Manne and Amia Srinivasan examine how narratives in incel communities convert rejection and loneliness into a sense of moral entitlement. And a wide range of research in psychology, sociology and philosophy explores how diminished self-worth can be redirected outward: into anger, blame and opposition.\n\nWhen movements are formed and sustained in this way, they are no longer organised around a shared vision of the good. Instead, they are structured by shared animosity. Opposition isn\u2019t incidental. It becomes the structure through which meaning, coherence and solidarity are generated.\n\nOften, these narratives begin with real problems and legitimate grievances \u2013 the economic case certainly does. The most effective narratives are superficially plausible. But they tend to be exaggerated and simplistic. It may be true that economic opportunities are scarce and financial security is precarious. But theressentimentnarrative turns this into a story of blame and hostility, painting a simple picture of who is responsible and what can be done about it. It transforms genuine frustration into wholesale animosity.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why these movementsneedenemies. They define themselves through rejection. Unlike contingently negative orientations \u2013 which are built around the pursuit of some good, some value worth realising \u2013 constitutively negative orientations draw their energy from resistance, antagonism and negation. Their integrity depends on the persistence of something to oppose. The result is a kind of political metabolism that requires enemies to function. If the enemy disappears, the orientation loses its shape.\n\nThis is not simply a matter of having enemies, which is common to many political movements. Nor is it a criticism of all forms of opposition; many just causes require resistance and a focus on enemies. The key point is structural: in constitutively negative orientations, opposition is pursued for its own sake. Opposition is no longer a means to an end; it is the end itself. Resolution becomes a threat rather than a goal, for resolution would rob the movement of the very antagonism that gives it purpose.\n\nViewed in this light, the Carlson monologues and Trump rallies aren\u2019t simply strategic or performative. They\u2019re sustaining a structure of belonging built around the rhetoric of attack. What the movements share is an inability to rest, to consolidate, to affirm. They live through negation.\n\nWith all of that in mind, we can now see the structure of grievance politics more clearly. In the traditional picture, grievance begins with ideals. We have definite ideas about what the world should be like. We look around the world and see that it fails to meet these values, that it contains certain injustices. From there, we identify people responsible for these injustices, and blame them.",

            "text": "But grievance politics operates differently. It begins not with ideals, but with unease, with feelings of powerlessness, failure, humiliation or inadequacy. Political and ethical rhetoric is offered that transforms these self-directed negative emotions into hostility, rage and blame. Negative emotions that would otherwise remain internal find a new outlet, latching on to ever-new enemies and grievances. The vision that redirects these emotions will cite particular values and goals, but the content of those values and goals doesn\u2019t matter all that much. What\u2019s most important is that the values and goals justify the hostility. If the world changes, the values and ideals can shift. But the emotional need remains constant: to find someone or something to oppose.\n\nThat\u2019s why traditional modes of engagement with grievance politics will backfire. People often ask: why not just give them some of what they want? Why not compromise, appease or meet them halfway? Surely, if you satisfy the grievance, the hostility will subside?\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t. The moment one demand is met, another appears. The particular goals and demands are not the point. They are just vehicles for expressing opposition. What\u2019s really being sustained is the emotional orientation: the need for enemies. Understanding grievance politics as a constitutively negative orientation \u2013 as a stance that draws its energy and coherence from opposition itself \u2013 changes how we respond. It explains why fact-checking, appeasement and policy concessions fail: they treat symptoms, rather than the cause. If opposition itself is the source of emotional resolution and identity, then resolution feels like a loss rather than a gain. It drains the movement\u2019s animating force. That\u2019s why each appeasement is followed by a new complaint, a new enemy, a new cause for outrage. The point is not to win; the point is to keep fighting and condemning.\n\nSeeing the dynamic in this way also clarifies what real resistance would require. The aim isn\u2019t just to rebut false claims, to condemn hostility or to attempt appeasement. The solution is to redirect the energies that grievance politics mobilises. To do so, we need alternative forms of meaning, identity and belonging, which satisfy those needs in a way that doesn\u2019t depend on hostile antagonism. We need an orientation that is grounded not in grievance, but in affirmation. One that draws strength not from hostility, but from commitment to something worth loving, revering or cherishing.\n\nWhat we need, then, are narratives that can sustaindevotion.Devotion is a form of attachment that combines love or reverence with commitment and a willingness to endure. It orients a person toward something they regard as intrinsically worthwhile \u2013 something that gives shape to a life, even in the face of difficulty or doubt. Like constitutively negative orientations, devotion can provide identity, purpose and belonging. But it does so without requiring an enemy. Its energy comes not from opposition, but from fidelity to a value that\u2019s seen as worthy of ongoing care.\n\nIn my own work, I\u2019ve argued that devotion can supply a stable sense of meaning, identity and purpose, without lapsing into antagonism and dogmatism. This picture resonates with Josiah Royce\u2019sclaimthat loyalty \u2013 which he understands as a form of devotion \u2013 provides \u2018a personal solution of the hardest of human practical problems, the problem: \u201cFor what do I live? Why am I here? For what am I good? Why am I needed?\u201d\u2019 It aligns with Harry Frankfurt\u2019sclaimthat a person\u2019s life is meaningful only if it is devoted to goods that the person cares about for their own sake, and with Thomas Aquinas\u2019s observation that \u2018the direct and principal effect of devotion is the spiritual joy of the mind \u2026\u2019 Devotion, so understood, is a steadfast responsiveness to what we cherish, capable of bringing deep, serene fulfilment without requiring an enemy.",
