            "text": "Pope Francis waters a tree planted by a representative of the Indigenous communities of the Amazon in the Vatican gardens, 4 October 2019. Photo by Andreas Solaro/AFP/Getty Images\n\nis a writer and journalist based in the Washington, DC area. He is the author ofWhat Doesn\u2019t Kill Us Makes Us(2022). His work has appeared inThe New Yorker,The Atlantic,The New York Times MagazineandThe Guardian, among others.\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere, it\u2019s often taken for granted that the Catholic Church is a conservative institution with little engagement in the fate of the natural world. And for ample reason. Consider the biblical verse that\u2019s slithered into modernity like a false prophet,Genesis 1:28.Here, God tells Adam and Eve: \u2018Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and all the living things that crawl on the earth.\u2019 This single verse has been held accountable for creating a permission structure that\u2019s allowed generations of humans to hunt and fish and kill and maim and pollute; to strip field and forest of vegetation, to mine, drill and frack.\n\nChristianity is an inherently human-centred religion. In hispaper\u2018The Historical Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis\u2019 (1967), the historian LynnWhite Jrpointed to Christianity\u2019s culpability in our plundering of the environment. \u2018Christianity is the most anthropocentric religion the world has seen,\u2019 he writes; \u2018in absolute contrast to ancient paganism and Asia\u2019s religions,\u2019 Christianity \u2018not only established a dualism of man and nature but also insisted that it is God\u2019s will that man exploit nature for his proper ends.\u2019 White casts the Church as a covert actor in the brutalisation of our planet, one that \u2018bears a huge burden of guilt\u2019. His prominence has helped this view solidify over the past half-century.\n\nOver the same period, there\u2019s been a notable shift \u2013 largely associated with the evangelical movement \u2013 that\u2019s seen Christians turn inwards, increasingly fixating on their own moral arc. According to the theologian Terrence Ehrman at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, \u2018Christian belief in God the Creator has been eclipsed\u2019 by \u2018belief in Jesus Christ the Redeemer\u2019. With that comes a near-fanatical focus on sin, repentance and a striving for personal redemption. The emphasis is on the believer\u2019s personal relationship with an empowering Christ and a quest for salvation, with all its heavenly rewards. The personal narrativising narrows the scope of the faith to the first person: a kind of bootstrap individualism interpolated into Christian doctrine. What matters to the faithful is not so much the state of the world but rather the state of their own soul.\n\nGiven this, Catholicism would appear to be the last place you\u2019d find radical innovation that takes climate consciousness to heart. But were you to look beyond the Church\u2019s contemporary reputation, and see the full sweep of its history, you\u2019d uncover another version of the religion. In this form of Christianity, there\u2019s a shimmering common thread that\u2019s often obscured today, dedicated to radical change, valiant acts of compassion, and a solidarity with all of God\u2019s creation.\n\nJesus Christ preached a radical way of living that shifted his followers\u2019 priorities away from the strict observation of Jewish rites and rituals and towards an injunction to love both God and their neighbour \u2018as thyself\u2019. Neighbours in this usage was a universal category, including the hungry, poor, sick, and incarcerated \u2013 all the individuals scrabbling on the margins of society.\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew emphasises the primacy of this responsibility in distinguishing between those who are worthy of the kingdom of heaven and those who are not: \u2018For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\u2019 Jesus tells \u2018the righteous\u2019: \u2018whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u2019 Throughout the New Testament, Jesus demonstrates a compassion and solidarity with the naked, needy, crippled, and blind, positioning those on the lowest rungs of society as the most beloved of his ministry. In the process, he set the stage for much of the radical Christian thinking that was to come.",

            "text": "When the plague swept the Roman Empire in the4th century,striking large population centres like Caesarea, Romans fled to evade contamination. Evidence suggests, however, that some Christians elected to stay. The historian Eusebius of Caesarea noted how Christians \u2018gave practical proof of their sympathy and humanity. All day long some of them tended to the dying and to their burial, countless numbers with no one to care for them.\u2019 Though exhausted and withered from famine, Christians who remained in the plague-stricken city distributed bread to the sick. Before long, their deeds were hanging \u2018oneveryone\u2019s lips\u2019.\n\nWhen the plague resurfaced in Italy in the14th century,a Majorcan Catholic named Roch risked his life by tending to the sick and dying in public hospitals on his pilgrimage to Rome. A century later, the Augustinian friar Martin Luther refused to leave the city of Wittenberg when the plague swept through Germany, opting to stay with his wife and tend to the infirm. \u2018Those who are engaged in a spiritual ministry,\u2019 he wrote later, must \u2018remain steadfast before the peril of death,\u2019 adding: \u2018We have a plain command from Christ: \u201cA good shepherd lays down his life for thesheep \u2026\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nIn the modern era, Christians have pioneered the care ministered in leper colonies, established thousands of mission hospitals, and set up clinics focused on maternal and neonatal health in sub-Saharan Africa. But it isn\u2019t just the sick and dying that Catholics have historically taken up as a moral cause. The Catholic Worker Movement, founded in 1933 by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, began as a newspaper: its mission, to let those \u2018who think that there is no hope for the future, no recognition of their plight\u2019 know that \u2018there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual, but for their material welfare.\u2019 The Catholic Worker Movement aspired to \u2018live in accordance with the justice and charity of Jesus Christ.\u2019 Day, Maurin and other Catholics affiliated with the movement established these \u2018houses of hospitality\u2019 all over the US \u2013 places where those in need could go for food, shelter and clothing. In the decades during and after the Depression, more than 100 of these houses were founded nationwide (today, there are nearly 150 operating in the US, and dozens more worldwide), some serving thousands of peoplea day.\n\nA similar drive to seek justice and relief for the downtrodden took root in Latin America following the second Latin American Bishops\u2019 Conference, in Medell\u00edn, Columbia, in 1968. There, bishops from Central and South America drafted a series of documents focused on moving beyond Catholic pedagogy and directly improving their parishioners\u2019 lives. The bishops wanted to combat the \u2018institutionalised violence\u2019 of poverty in their nations, and began to espouse what would eventually be called the \u2018preferential option for the poor\u2019. This revolutionary tenet asserted that God, as he is depicted in the Bible, instructed his followers to address the needs of the poor first.\n\nThese ideas eventually coalesced into what we now know as liberation theology, a politically charged form of Catholicism that swept Latin America in the 1970s and \u201980s. Personified by audacious, visionary figures like Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, \u00d3scar Romero and Leonardo Boff, liberation theology was miles away from any cloistered Catholicism. Instead of sleepy priestcraft and pedantry, these Christians were working to bring the revolutionary spirit of Jesus Christ into the present day. As Guti\u00e9rrez wrote inA Theology of Liberation(1973): \u2018The denunciation of injustice implies the rejection of the use of Christianity to legitimise the established order.\u2019\n\nWhile these movements may appear to represent breakaway strains of the religion, they\u2019re all firmly rooted in Christ\u2019s example and the Catholic doctrine that followed. Catholic social teaching is a part of Church theology that consists of seven pillars. Originally laid out by PopeLeo XIIIin an 1891 encyclical, the pillars include the sanctity of all human life, prioritising the needs of the poor, the dignity of work and workers, and care for God\u2019s creation. These pillars are inspired by the religion\u2019s prophets, who, according to the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, \u2018announced God\u2019s special love for the poor and called God\u2019s people to a covenant of love and justice.\u2019",

Through their movements and the moral acts they\u2019ve inspired, Catholics are not using their religion to \u2018legitimise the established order\u2019; they\u2019re imposing a spiritual responsibility on themselves to change the world for the better and \u2018lighten the sum total of suffering,\u2019 as Day put it. This dimension of the Catholic Church can be obscured by the baggage and hypocrisy that barnacle onto many perennial institutions, yet it is critical to understanding how Christianity can be a force for change today. In particular, Catholic social teaching advocates care for the whole of God\u2019s creation, a pillar colloquially referred to as \u2018creation care\u2019. This tenet isn\u2019t an archaic, mouldering article of faith, either. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops maintains that care for God\u2019s creation is \u2018a requirement of our faith\u2019, with \u2018fundamental moral and ethical dimensions that cannot be ignored.\u2019 While most people may not associate the Catholic Church with environmental justice, many of its most revered leaders have been advocating for Earth for a long time.\n\nHuman impact on the climate is calamitous. The global surface temperature in 2025 is on pace to be amongthe warmestever recorded;sea levelsare climbing; and abiodiversity crisisis rapidly underway, with a 2024 World Wildlife Fundreportshowing that wildlife populations have experienced an average population decline of more than70 percent since 1970. By every ecological metric, the figures are staggering. At first blush, the role that the Catholic Church and its roughly1.4 billionglobal followers might play in this planetary crisis is not immediately clear. The Church is not Greenpeace, the Environmental Defense Fund or the Climate Action Network \u2013 it isn\u2019t an NGO with an explicit objective to fight climate change, promote decarbonisation, or preserve the world\u2019s languishing biodiversity. What it is, however, is a thought leader with the authority and credibility to influence people\u2019s attitudes and beliefs.\n\nIf you approach the Bible outside of an anthropomorphic lens, you find that even Genesis reveres the nonhuman aspects of God\u2019s creation, notably in passages in which God looks admiringly on plants and animals, land and sea: after each day of layering in one more facet on his loamy canvas, God \u2018saw that it was good\u2019. A passel of psalms celebrates the full breadth of creation.Psalm 104,for example, praises a vast ecosystem in harmonious balance: \u2018The trees of the Lord drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon, which you planted./There the birds build their nests; the stork in the junipers, its home./The high mountains are for wild goats; the rocky cliffs, a refuge for badgers.\u2019 If attention is \u2018the natural prayer we make\u2019, as the French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche suggested in 1674, then many psalms might be considered exultant prayers for the natural world, testifying to an elusive, heterogeneous beauty.\n\nDuring his relatively brief tenure as the head of the Catholic Church, PopeBenedict XVIcondemned our extractive relationship with the environment. \u2018The external deserts in the world are growing, because the internal deserts have become so vast,\u2019 he said during his first homily as pope in 2005. \u2018Therefore the earth\u2019s treasures no longer serve to build God\u2019s garden for all to live in, but they have been made to serve the powers of exploitation and destruction.\u2019\n\nBartholomew I of Constantinople (technically, the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church) advocates so passionately for ecological issues that he\u2019s often referred to as the \u2018Green Patriarch\u2019. At an environmental symposium held in a Greek Orthodox Church in California in 1997, he became one of the first individuals to articulate a nascent concept that would eventually become known as ecological sin. \u2018For humans to cause species to become extinct and to destroy the biological diversity of God\u2019s creation \u2026 For humans to degrade the integrity of Earth by causing changes in its climate, by stripping the Earth of its natural forests, or destroying its wetlands \u2026 These are sins,\u2019 he said.",

Mother Earth, Francis laments, \u2018now cries out to us because of the harm we have inflicted on her by our irresponsible use and abuse of the goods with which God has endowed her. We have come to see ourselves as her lords and masters, entitled to plunder herat will.\u2019\n\nUnconstrained by the anodyne, emotionally neutered language of academic science, Pope Francis explicitly ties our environmental crisis to human sin, myopic pride, and an anthropocentric mindset that sees our relationship to Earth in coldly utilitarian terms. His encyclical lays out how the impacts of climate change reverberate through the worlds of plants, animals and vulnerable populations, triggering a cascade effect that imperils both natural ecosystems and the global poor.\n\nIn making these connections, Francis articulates a larger, bolder thesis that frames global warming as a starkly moral issue. Climate change is both a cause and an effect of theextreme inequalitywe see in the world: one that further victimises the most vulnerable lives while perpetuating the gross power imbalance that permitted it in the first place. \u2018This is why the earth herself, burdened and laid waste, is among the most abandoned and maltreated of our poor,\u2019 he writes. \u2018She \u201cgroans in travail\u201d \u2026\u2019Laudato si\u2019is, in many ways, a culmination of many of the Catholic moral crusades that preceded it \u2013 ecological sin, liberation theology, the Catholic Worker Movement. Like the poor, sick, and stigmatised, Francis decried how \u2018the earth herself\u2019 is now being immiserated by exploitation and indifference.\n\nIt is difficult to overstate just how influentialLaudato si\u2019has been to the Church\u2019s followers. In conversations I\u2019ve had with nearly two dozen Catholic theologians and activists, they consistently characterise Francis\u2019s encyclical as a watershed event, a clarion call that connects a veritable scientific reality with the spiritual conscience of believers. \u2018Pope Francis writingLaudato si\u2019was this huge gift to people who\u2019ve been caring for creation for so long,\u2019 Anna Johnson, the North America director of theLaudato Si\u2019Movement, told me. When she reached out to fellow Catholics in the wake of its publication, \u2018We were all like: \u201cWe\u2019re crying with this encyclical \u2013 it\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\u2019\n\nFor other Catholics,Laudato si\u2019offered the opportunity to grow more comfortable in connecting their passion for the environment to their faith. It gave the cartographer Molly Burhans confidence to found GoodLands, an organisation that works to map the Catholic Church\u2019s vast landholdings for conservation and humanitarian purposes. \u2018I got the courage to do that from Pope Francis,\u2019 she said. \u2018He brought together the best ecologists, the best scientists to consult onLaudato si\u2019.\u2019\n\nThe encyclical arguably opens a new chapter in the Church\u2019s history by encouraging the faithful to be more assertive in embodying the environmental pillar of Catholic social teaching. TheLaudato Si\u2019Movement, for example, is a global network that collaborates with hundreds of Catholic organisations all over the world to promote sustainability and divestment from the fossil-fuel industry. In anticipation of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) in France, the Movement gathered close to1 millionsignatures from Catholics around the world to petition the UN to include language limiting temperature rise to1.5 degrees.\u2018We collaborated in submitting these signatures to both the French presidency and also to Christiana Figueres, who was then the convener of the COP,\u2019 said Christina Lea\u00f1o, the associate director of theLaudato Si\u2019Movement. \u2018It was the only petition that pushed for keeping temperature rise below1.5 degrees,and it eventually made it into the final document.\u2019",

            "text": "Another major Catholic nonprofit, the Catholic Climate Covenant (CCC), takes a grassroots approach by partnering with parishioners all over the US to pursue projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability locally. \u2018We have close to 400 creation care teams,\u2019 Diana Marin, a programme manager at CCC, told me. Marin continues to be motivated by the legacy left by Pope Francis\u2019s words. \u2018Pope Francis spoke aboutlos descartados, the thrown-away people. And so that call to environmental stewardship or that vocation to care for creation, I think that also calls us to care for those people and to rethink that way of living that throws people and things away.\u2019\n\nThe Catholic Church itself has taken some modest steps towards more substantively supporting environmental stewardship. In 2023, the Irish Bishops\u2019 Conference agreed to rewild30 percent of all parish land in Ireland by 2030. As the Conference explained: \u2018All are called to arrest the decline of biodiversity for the sake of the next generation.\u2019 Several years ago, the Church worked with Burhans to map all the land it owns in the US, for the purposes of eventually maintaining its properties more sustainably. The project saw GoodLands map more than 33,000 Catholic-affiliated properties, producing an exhaustive dataset that integrated the Church\u2019s official directory with assessors\u2019 information and commercial datasets to offer a comprehensive picture of Catholic Church landholdings inthe US.\n\nBurhans was enthusiastic \u2013 exuberant, even \u2013 about the Church\u2019s potential to be a world leader in environmental stewardship when we spoke. \u2018There\u2019s something that\u2019s inspired me from the start of this, this super-big vision/question,\u2019 she said. \u2018Which is: what if the Catholic Church became the largest global network of conservation and ecological regeneration the world has ever seen?\u2019\n\nBurhan\u2019s ambition notwithstanding, it may be quixotic to expect the Catholic Church to become a transformative actor in addressing the climate crisis. But it can serve as a lodestar for the world\u2019s billion-plus Catholics by centring the primacy of creation care. People\u2019s attitudes and feelings need to evolve internally before they\u2019re willing to change their behaviours. Because of the way the institution can set priorities for its followers, and impose moral urgency, the Church is uniquely suited to shake Christians out of the inertia \u2013 and self-centred anthropocentrism \u2013 that\u2019s taken hold for so many. If the impact of Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical is a harbinger and not a blip, it can continue to rouse them toward meaningful action.\n\nThe truth is that the Catholic Church is in a far better position to galvanise Christians than its Protestant counterpart in the US. American Protestantism has more than twice as many followers as Catholicism, with an interdenominational movement that encompasses Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals and Quakers. Its largest and most powerful contingent, the Evangelical movement, counts nearly a quarter of the US population among its flock. And it is this movement and its flagship denominations \u2013 Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans \u2013 that have become an animating force in US politics, agitating for the pro-life movement, resistance to LGBTQ rights, and the preservation of a conservative Christian nation (otherwise known as Christian nationalism). These platforms and allegiances make it difficult for the disparate strains of US Protestantism to coalesce around the issue of climate change \u2013 especially given its association with progressivism. \u2018They basically identify their Christian faith with the cause of American prosperity,\u2019 Norman Wirzba, a theologian at Duke University in North Carolina, and an Anabaptist, told me. \u2018They identify it with the flag.\u2019\n\nWirzba recalls having a recent discussion with several pastors based in the South, on holding a potential workshop about climate issues among their congregations. He didn\u2019t get far before he was sharply rebuffed: \u2018It was depressing to hear pastors of major-sized churches tell me that their congregations are not interested in what Jesus had to say about ethical or political issues.\u2019 Protestant denominations in the US are also the keenest advocates of a personal religion that cultivates a private relationship with Jesus Christ in the hopes of personal salvation. \u2018It\u2019s about getting your soul into heaven,\u2019 Wirzba said. \u2018It\u2019s a very individualistic faith.\u2019",

Whether it\u2019s a moral crusade against poverty, disease or systemic injustice, the Church has long given people the courage to sublimate themselves to a nobler cause.
