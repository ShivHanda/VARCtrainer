            "text": "is an English writer. His novels includeDamascus(1998),Dry Bones(2004),Lazarus Is Dead(2011) andActs of the Assassins(2015), shortlisted for the UK Goldsmiths Prize, for novels that \u2018extend the possibilities of the novel form\u2019. His non-fiction includes the memoirsThe Day That Went Missing(2017),winner of the 2018 PEN Ackerley Award for literary autobiography, andSad Little Men(2021).\n\nCreative writing used to be a human prerogative: do it well, do it badly, but either way endorse the consensus that to write about human experience was worth the candle and the coffee. Here was an essential human act, so much so that poetry formed a critical part of the computer pioneer Alan Turing\u2019s original test: to determine whether an unseen respondent to a series of questions was human or a mechanical imposter. The Turing Test is often simplified to denote a single crossing point between two territories, human and machine. Pass the test, and artificial intelligence can stroll on over to our side of the line. Take a look around. Decide what to do with us. But, first, it has to pass.\n\nIn the paper \u2018Computing Machinery and Intelligence\u2019 (1950), published in the journalMind, Turing set out his objective: \u2018to consider the question, \u201cCan machines think?\u201d\u2019 In true human fashion, he immediately re-phrases the question, at some length, and eventually arrives at the \u2018imitation game\u2019, modelled on a drawing-room entertainment from before the internet, before television. The original game he has in mind involves a guesser in the hotseat who poses questions to a man (X) and a woman (Y), who are out of sight and hearing in a separate room. The guesser has to determine from their written answers which is the man and which the woman. X tries to mislead, and wins if the guesser is wrong; Y wins if the guesser is right. Try it,it\u2019s fun.\n\nIn this context, the first question posed in Turing\u2019s proposed test is less surprising than at first it seems: \u2018Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?\u2019 Next, Turing asks, equally politely: \u2018Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.\u2019 Two questions in, and the contested boundary between human and machine thinking is already looking for answers in literature, in art. Turing\u2019s 1950s version of X \u2013 the participant aiming to mislead \u2013 replies: \u2018Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.\u2019 To imagine this answer, in the second phase of his game, Turing\u2019s complicated brain is playing the role of a machine playing X, hidden from sight and typing its answers, pretending to be a man (who previously played the game pretending to be a woman). I know, but if the test were easy an air-fryer couldpass it.\n\nTuring isn\u2019t suggesting that a machine can\u2019t write poetry. In the convoluted logic of the imitation game, X calculates that in 1950 ordinary people didn\u2019t write poetry, a commonsense assumption that every computer masquerading as human should know. Among other prejudices from the mid-20th century, Turing\u2019s paper makes incautious references to race, religion and the Constitution of the United States. He likens the inability to see computers as sentient as equivalent to the \u2018Moslem view that women have no souls\u2019. Turing wades in: he doesn\u2019t compute as wewould now.\n\nAnd neither do the future computers of 2026 that he was trying to envisage. Any of today\u2019s large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT or Claude, can write an instant sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge. I typed in Turing\u2019s test question, andClaude 4threw up 14 lines of poetry including the abbreviated word \u2018mathemat\u2019cal\u2019, for the scansion. The poem made sense, and was formally a sonnet, and appeared in seconds.",

            "text": "Whether or not this counts as thinking, Turing intuits that the frontier he\u2019s marking out will be picketed by the arts. In his paper, he picks a fight with an eminent neuroscientist of the time,Sir GeoffreyJefferson of the Royal Society, who believed that \u2018Not until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brain \u2013 that is, not only write it but know that it had written it.\u2019 For Jefferson, addressing the Royal College of Surgeons in his 1949 Lister Oration, mechanising the efforts of the infinite monkeys on typewriters didn\u2019t really count.\n\nThese days, in the arts, it\u2019s harder to share Jefferson\u2019s confidence. The advances made by AI prick at artistic vanity \u2013 the work of a human artist can\u2019t be all that special if a machine can replicate the results almost instantly. That hurts. A great human artist, we\u2019d like to believe, amplifies and defends the exceptionalist spirit of our species but, in an echo of the anxieties that haunted early photography, a demonised version of AI threatens to steal away our souls. Encroaching on the best of what we can do and make and be, machine art intrudes onto sacred territory. Creative artists are supposed to be special, inimitable.\n\nTuring\u2019s Imitation Game paper was published 14 years after the first Writers\u2019 Workshop convened at the University of Iowa, in 1936. Turing may not have known, with his grounding in maths at King\u2019s College Cambridge, that elements of machine learning had already evolved across the Atlantic in the apparently unrelated field of creative writing. Before Iowa, the Muse; after Iowa, a method for assembling literary content not dissimilar to the functioning oftoday\u2019s LLMs.\n\nFirst, work out what effective writing looks like. Then, develop a process that walks aspiring writers towards an imitation of the desired output. The premise extensively tested by Iowa \u2013 and every creative writing MFA since \u2013 is that a suite of learnable rules can generate text that, as a bare minimum, resembles passable literary product. Rare is the promising screenwriter unfamiliar with Syd Field\u2019s Three-Act Structure or Christopher Vogler\u2019s Hero\u2019s Journey: cheat codes that promise the optimal sequence for acts, scenes, drama and dialogue. In the same way that an LLM is designed to \u2018think\u2019, these templates are a form of reverse engineering: first study how the mechanics ofJawsorWitnessmade those movies sing, then identify transferable components for reassembly to achieve similar artistic success further down the line.\n\nTo a computer-programmer, reverse engineering as a machine-learning mechanism is known asback-propagation. InA Brief History of Intelligence(2023), Max S Bennett shows how this methodology has already helped in the development of image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and self-driving cars. Supervising coders work to isolate the required answer in advance, then go back to nudge input responses until the artificial neural network arrives at the pre-set solution.\n\nIf only writing were so simple. According to figures from Data USA, up to 4,000 students graduate each year with creative writing MFAs in the US. No one expects that number of Great American Novels to show for so much studying, despite the fact that many hopeful writing careers start with the prompt mentality invited by Chat GPT:I want to write a bestseller like the one that blew me away last summer. Or, for the more adventurous:something new but relatable, a novel/memoir hybrid with literary credibility and strong narrative momentum, like a cross between Lee Child and Annie Ernaux. Thank you. I\u2019ll wait. But not very patiently.\n\nClearly, when the end result is compared with the original intention, the back-propagation method is fallible for creative writing courses and LLMs alike. To revisit Jefferson, as quoted by Turing, the finished work is undermined when inspired by the wrong \u2018thoughts and emotions\u2019, whether blind ambition in student writers or blind obedience in computers. Something more is required, and the mysterious magic ingredient has been debated in English on the printed page since at least 1580, when Sir Philip Sidney reached for the essence of exemplary creative writing inAn Apology for Poetry. When it worked, he concluded, good writing could both teach and delight. It provided a guide to living well in a more accessible form than theology or history or philosophy.

            "text": "So special, in fact, that no one has yet been able to break down the findings of English literature departments \u2013 what makes literature work \u2013 into sufficient granular detail to reformulate as instructions actionable by an LLM. Or by a creative writing student. Nor are the efforts being made in this area by other art-forms particularly encouraging. ArtEmis is a large-scale dataset designed to record and subsequently predict emotional responses to works of visual art. The scheme matches emotional annotations from more than 6,500 participants to textual explanations of what they\u2019re seeing, and from this data ArtEmis hopes to enable the back-propagated creation of artworks that provoke equivalent emotional responses.\n\nThe understanding seems to be that if a machine can create a visual image that generates a controlled set of feels, then art will have been successfully created. Which sounds plausible, except human emotional responses are notoriously capricious. The ArtEmis procedure already has an analogue precedent in Hollywood, but if focus groups worked reliably for the arts, then cinemas would be full of bangers. It\u2019s worth remembering that the 2023 strike action by the Writers Guild of America won significant protections against the use of generative AI in screenwriting, specifically disallowing the replacement of human writers by AI. This hasn\u2019t noticeably boosted the production of great art movies. Human writers still make so-so films. Without any intervention from AI, we continue to paint indifferent canvasses and write forgettable novels.\n\nBad art is something human beings love to do, in vast numbers. It\u2019s part of who we are, and when abandoned by inspiration we trust in the same methods we\u2019ve programmed into LLMs. As predicted by Turing, \u2018digital computers \u2026 can in fact mimic the actions of a human computer very closely\u2019, and for the creation of failed artistic product we\u2019ve taught artificial intelligence all our dodges. Creative writing that falls short, whether originating in a garret or in an Nvidia chip, \u2018writes\u2019 by selecting language units that commonly fit together, as recognised from published material available in the public domain. Familiar word combinations are assembled into almost convincing sentences, a tired use of language formerly called out as clich\u00e9. LLMs are clich\u00e9 machines, trained on a resilient human weakness for generating maximum content with minimum effort.\n\nThis explains the headline in June 2025 in the British publishing industry\u2019s leading trade magazineThe Bookseller: \u2018AI \u201cLikely\u201d to Produce Bestseller by 2030\u2019. The headline referenced a conference speech by Philip Stone of Nielsen, a company that compiles UK book-sales data. I expect he\u2019s right about that bestseller, because LLMs will come for genre writing first \u2013 police procedurals, spy thrillers, romances \u2013 re-treading identifiable formulas with proven popular appeal. Eager to please (\u2018Hi Rich, how are you today?\u2019), AI also has the advantage, shared by surprisingly few human writers, of being able to churn out derivative product without embarrassment.\n\nFortunately for everybody else, the endless capacity of an AI to deliver rule-bound and resolution-directed narrative has an unexpected benefit: AI is the tool that will prove not all writing has the same value.\n\nTo escape the dead man\u2019s handle of clich\u00e9, readers live in hope for organic associations, speculative leaps and surprise inferences. Whereas, to an AI, which is fed the answer before the question, \u2018surprise\u2019 remains an elusive concept. This objection to machine thinking was raised as long ago as 1842 by Ada Lovelace about one of the earliest computers, Charles Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine (for historical context, Iowa\u2019s first creative writing get-together, though informal, took place in 1897). \u2018The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever tooriginateanything,\u2019 Lovelace observed. \u2018It can dowhatever we know how to order itto perform.\u2019 Her italics emphasise the contrast with human thinking where originality, among artists at least, is a cherished value.",

The Turner Prize, for example, awarded to the strongest UK contemporary art exhibition in any given year, is permeated by a sense that if it\u2019s not new it\u2019s not art. For visual artists, formal curiosity comes with the job, exploring new ways of making to invite new ways of seeing. Writing, on the other hand, happily rewards the comfort of familiar forms, which justifies, in the UK, the existence of a separate Goldsmiths Prize for fiction that \u2018extends the possibilities of the novel form\u2019. Because most other prize-winning novels aren\u2019t doing that.\n\nWriting has been reluctant to imagine new ways of reading, despite the vistas opened up by new technologies. Transferring books wholesale to Kindle and Audible is little more than digital haulage, and makes literature, in its complacency, vulnerable to proficient AI re-runs of familiar material, lowering the odds on that imminent AI-generated bestseller. Writers, or more accurately their publishers, seem to have mislaid any sense of urgency around the importance of difficulty, or curiosity about the astonishing returns that formally daring work can provide. It\u2019s a rare book proposal submitted to a mainstream publisher that dares promise a book that\u2019s not like all the other books.\n\nOriginality, in the arts as in science, enables the human project to move forward. Any discovery that is new and true extends the scope of reality. In this context, art that only pretends to be original won\u2019t get us anywhere very interesting.\n\nThe Turing Test is basically a test of lying. Can a machine, adopting a recognisably human strategy, pretend to be something it isn\u2019t? Passing Turing\u2019s Test calls for an act of deception, leaving the deceived human interrogator vulnerable to primitive fears about impersonation and imposture. Art is supposed to see the truth beyond this kind of lie, and the original creations worth defending are in a category so extraordinary, because of the intensity and authenticity of Jefferson\u2019s \u2018thoughts and emotions felt\u2019, that they exist in a permanent present tense. What Toni Morrison does is unbelievable.\n\nWhereas what an AI does is probabilistic. An LLM\u2019s calculation of the most likely sequence of words is theleastlikely way to create great writing. Anyone working at a more emotionally engaged level than statistical probability, genuinely creating new work, has a better chance of resonating with readers, however that affinity is expressed. \u2018If literature is a street brawl between the courageous and the banal,\u2019 Greg Baxter wrote in his memoirA Preparation for Death(2010), \u2018I bring the toughest gang I know: the pure killers, the insane.\u2019 Baxter\u2019s literary gangsters do not kneel before the most likely next word. Baxter values his \u2018pure killers, the insane\u2019, while computers as envisioned by Turing receive instructions to be \u2018obeyed correctly and in the right order.\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that LLMs can be asked to imitate transgression, but obeying that instruction makes them ludicrously phony and the enemies of art, even though in their advanced contemporary forms they appear better equipped to respond to Turing\u2019s stabs at English literature. In 2026, for example, ChatGPT and Claude make short work of the Turing Test challenge of 1950 to explain Shakespeare\u2019s creative choices inSonnet 18.Why a \u2018summer\u2019s day\u2019 and not a \u2018spring day\u2019? Easy (just ask them, they know the answer). LLMs now ace most of Turing\u2019s original questions, and if they can\u2019t write a sonnet like Shakespeare, then neither can I. That doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t think, and Turing makes the same reasonable allowance for computers. They too are allowed their limitations, and his attitude to machine intelligence follows the logic of Denis Diderot\u2019s parrot: if the illusion of understanding is sufficiently convincing, it qualifies as understanding. The machines are faking it until theymake it.",

            "text": "Or in Turing\u2019s words: \u2018God has given an immortal soul to every man and woman, but not to any other animal or to machines. Hence no animal or machine can think. I am unable to accept any part of this.\u2019 Turing invokes God for the sake of the 1950s, but he rejected the idea that humankind is \u2018necessarily superior\u2019 to the rest of creation, whether man-made or otherwise. He sides with materialist philosophers like Democritus and Thomas Hobbes, seeing the mind \u2013 whatever it might be \u2013 as located entirely in the physical structure of the brain. An AI is a physical structure, leading Turing to judge that whatever an AI can\u2019t do, it can\u2019tdo yet.\n\nIn which case, how should writers and artists react to this situation as it stands now? We can attach stickers to the dustjackets of novels saying \u2018Human Written\u2019, as recently trialled by the UK publisher Faber and Faber. Visual artists have labels that say \u2018Created with Human Intelligence\u2019 or \u2018Not by AI\u2019, and maybe hashtags can keep AI at a distance until a generational talent arrives to save human honour in a blaze of truly original style and content. Take that, AI. See how much catching up you have to do.\n\nMore proactively, in the meantime, the rest of us can defy AI creep by defending and encouraging the human ambition to make art, unassisted, whether successful or otherwise. Art is an affirmation of human existence, the transmission and reception of messages about encounter and connection. One inner life can touch another and, for best results, nurture a creative process that no LLM can imitate. Marcel Duchamp called art \u2018this missing link, not the links which exist\u2019, an insight that arrives in the21st centuryas a straight refutation of the imitative LLM creative model, stuck in its feedback loops and repeating existing sequences. Not for ChatGPT the electric shorting between inner lives, which in writing is most readily accessible in memoir. What anyone remembers is theirs alone, an undigitised storehouse of authentic human experience.\n\nWhen Turing was deep in thought, according to his biographer Andrew Hodges, he used to scratch his side-parted hair and make a squelching noise with his mouth. Inside his head, at around the time he devised the Turing Test, he heard sceptical voices telling him a computer would never be able to be \u2018kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly\u2019. His future machine brains wouldn\u2019t \u2018have initiative, have a sense of humour, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream,\u2019 and so on. Turing was making comparisons with his remembered lived experience. What AIs couldn\u2019t do was memoir.\n\nTaking this idea as my starting point, I recently launched theUniversal Turing Machine, a human proposal for a new way of writing and reading. The Universal Turing Machine is an expandable online grid of8 x 8squares, like a chessboard, and writers are invited to claim a grid for themselves and fill each of the squares with 1,000 words of memory. The reader can move randomly between memories and voices, playing an equally active role in the space Duchamp identified: \u2018art is the gap\u2019. Twice a year, I plan to tile new grids to those already online, steadily increasing the size of this collective experimental memoir, amplifying the diversity of human existence and creating a subjective encyclopaedia of true-to-life experience.\n\nThe Universal Turing Machine format is designed to encourage writing as a mode of thinking, which is what the arts \u2013 seeing, listening, writing, reading \u2013 have always offered. A memory that knows it\u2019s being remembered is up there with the hardest, cleverest kind of thinking we can do, and why, for the purposes of his test, Turing couldn\u2019t keep his hands off literature. AIs can\u2019t yet emulate writing as its own mode of thinking, or reading, or remembering, and it doesn\u2019t help to learn to write by readingeverything.
